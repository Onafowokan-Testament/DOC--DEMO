So it sounds like he's had a fever, no cough, a sore throat. So the first thing that we want to check to see or to rule out would be a strep throat and then well if that comes back negative we will go from there and think about other viral causes versus strep throat as well."

108,"Um I'd say, maybe the, uh, the right side is a little bit more sore, but I think I can feel it on both sides of my neck.","OK, and how bad would you say your discomfort is 1 to 10, 10 being the worst."
109,"Um. I would say maybe a two or three if I move my neck I I can feel it more, but otherwise I can just barely notice that it's there.","OK, so it's not preventing you from sleeping, going to school, playing, things like that?"
110,"No, it's more so the sore throat when swallowing.","OK. OK. Um, have you noticed a fever at all?"
111,"Um, I have. Yeah I felt hot and Um I checked my temperature this morning and it was 38.7 I think it was. Is that a fever?","Yeah, I'd say that's a fever. We can also do another temperature check today."

163,Uh. I I think so yeah.,"OK, I ask because there's something called what you may be familiar with um it's called the kissing disease. In medical terminology, it's called mono, as caused by a virus called EBV, and so it could be that so we're covering all our bases."
164,"Oh, I've heard of mono before.","Yeah,"

166,"Um, no, I think that's you covered everything.","OK alright so I will will go off a few, we'll try to cover our basis and get you tested for mono which I would have to do like a monospot test and we can do rapid strep test as well to see if he has something called strep throat. But yeah, we'll see what those results come back as. And we'll go from there. Does that sound good?"
167,"Yeah, no, that sounds good.","OK, thank you."
168,"Yeah, so I just came in. I was a bit worried because I've been having this cough for around two years, which has been getting worse. But recently I've noticed that I see streaks of blood in the sputum that I'm producing. Before it just used to be like white but now I'm seeing over the last, I would say two months occasionally some streaks of blood.","OK, and the cough started two years ago."
169,Yeah.,"OK. And, it's been gradually getting worse over that time?"
170,"Yeah, I would say so. It's getting more frequent and worse in nature.",OK. And how much sputum are you bringing up an in a day?
171,"Probably like a, a couple teaspoons.","OK, and uh, is are you seeing like bright red blood when you're when you're coughing it up?"

173,"No. It's just like a little streaks. It's not really significant, it doesn't feel like the whole production of the sputum, but just like little streaks that I've noticed.","OK and um is the cough worse, at any particular time of day?"
174,"Um, it definitely gets worse when I'm doing more activities and then also when I get like some viral infections. But other than that, it's pretty much always there.","OK, anything that that makes it worse? You said some viral infections. Have you had a viral infection recently?"
175,"Yeah, like in the last two years, I've probably had two or three viral infections, just just just cold cold symptoms.",Has there been anything that you've tried to make the cough better?
176,"I've tried the Tylenol Cold, hasn't really worked. Tried just other over the counter medications, haven't really worked.","OK. And prior to two years ago um, were you experiencing any similar symptoms like, uh, like this cough or bringing up blood before?"
177,"In the past, I've always had a somewhat of a cough like I have COPD. So I've always had a little bit of a cough here and there, but over the last two years I feel that it's been getting much worse.","OK, have you been diagnosed with chronic bronchitis before?"

184,"No, not really I've just been sitting around like I can barely walk that much anymore too. I used to be able to walk at least 400 meters around the block, but now I can barely even go to the kitchen.","OK, is this because of the shortness of breath when you are are exerting?"
185,"Yeah, that and I just start coughing so much that I just have to sit down.","OK. Um, and have you been having any headaches?"
186,No headaches.,"Alright, and how about and how is your appetite been?"

201,"Not weakness, I'll just say more fatigue.","Alright so I know you told me a COPD, but do you have any other medical diagnosis?"
202,"Yeah, I have high blood pressure as well.",Alright.
203,I think I have high cholesterol too.,"I see, OK. Do you take any medications regularly?"
204,"Yeah, so for the cholesterol taking Rosuvastatin and I forget what I'm taking for the blood pressure, but it's pretty well under control.","OK, do you use any inhalers for COPD?"
205,I used to. I used to have I think like 3 different inhalers but haven't had to use them for more than 10 years now.,"OK, and what was the reason for not needing them anymore?"
206,I just didn't have any symptoms for a pretty long time and my doc said like if I don't really need them then I could just stop.,"OK, and have you had any recent hospitalizations?"
207,No.,Any allergies to medications?
208,Nope.,Any surgeries that you had in the past?
209,No surgeries.,"OK, And are your vaccinations up to date?"
210,Yup.,"OK, and could you tell me a little bit about your social situation or living situation?"
211,"Yeah, so currently I'm just living by myself in an apartment. I've been there for more than 10 years now. Um, I am retired so I'm not working anymore. But yeah, that's that's me.","OK, great um. What did you do previously for for work? Did you have any exposures for two chemicals or dusts or asbestos? Things like of that nature?"
212,"Oh yes, I worked in the steel factory for most of my working life. I think yeah, there might have been some exposures to chemicals and dust particles. Asbestos I don't think there was exposure, but definitely I may have lived in places that had asbestos. I mean, yeah.","OK, how long have you been living where you you've been now?"
213,"So this this is like the one I'm living in is a new place, but before that, I lived in another apartment for around five years and that was a pretty old building.","OK, do you have any pets?"
214,"No pets, no.",OK um. And do you smoke cigarettes?
215,"Yeah, I smoke, I'd say around 20 cigarettes a day right now.","Alright, and did you smoke more previously?"
216,"Yeah, I think I've been smoking for almost like 40 years now and I used to smoke up to 30 cigarettes a day.","OK, do you smoke cannabis?"
217,No.,Alright. Do you drink alcohol?
218,"Um just maybe a couple times a month. Nothing, nothing throughout the week.","OK, so do you use any recreational drugs like IV drugs or opioids or cocaine?"
219,"No, nothing like that.",Alright. And anybody in the family have any similar symptoms before like coughing up blood or?
220,"No. Not that I know of. My father passed away from a heart attack when he was in his 60s. And I think my mother had a, um like I think one of the like, an arthritis. But yeah, like, but I think that was just like the one that you get with old age.","OK, like osteoarthritis?"
221,Yeah that that was the one.,OK. Any cancers in the family?
222,"Um, not that, one of my uncles had like um bladder cancer, but that's that's that's about it.","OK, and have you have you traveled anywhere recently or been around any sick contacts? Possibly people anybody who's had tuberculosis or any infections?"
223,"No, I've been pretty much to myself over the last few months, so not really.",OK um. Was there anything that you're worried that this could be?
224,"Um Yeah, just the blood I kind of got scared maybe I thought like you know what if it's a cancer? One of my friends had lung cancer and I I know I've been smoking for most of my life, so that's something I was worried about.","Um, I can certainly see that the concern and I understand where you're coming from. I think it would be very reasonable to investigate that today. So we'll start with a chest CT along with some lab work and we will get a CBC and some electrolytes, also get an ECG as well to just check your heart and we will see what what the investigations show"
225,Sounds good.,"OK, and um, other things that um to think about this could be, uh, also like to COPD I know it's been going on a long time, but possibly could have a pneumonia that's been lingering on, particularly if it's a fungal type of infection and as well as things like you mentioned you possibly unsure if you've had an asbestos exposure in the past and stuff like that can possibly lead to scarring of the lung, and so all of these factors will be looked into."
226,"OK, sounds good. Thank you so much.","Alright, you're welcome, thank you."
227,"So I've just been having this cough that I feel has just been getting worse, and I've also been feeling a bit short of breath for the last few months.","OK, could you tell me when the cough started?"
228,So I would say it started around two months ago.,"OK, and has the cough been dry or have you been bringing up sputum?"
229,"Uh, it's usually always, uh, produces like the sputum, and it's usually white or yellowish in colour.","OK, and how much sputum are you producing each day? Some, sometimes it's useful to think about like teaspoons or tablespoons."
230,I would say every time I cough like a teaspoon I probably have like. I don't know. Maybe 5 to 10 teaspoons a day.,"Uh OK, and is there any particular time of day that the cough is worse?"
231,"Um, not really. It's pretty, pretty much the same. Sometimes it is worse in the morning. Yeah, and sometimes it gets better when I go out for a smoke.",OK um. And have you noticed any blood?
232,"No, um I haven't noticed any blood.","OK, and have you had, so you had shortness of breath, when did that start?"
233,"It's around two months ago, around the same time.","OK, And. Is this? Do you have shortness of breath at rest or is it when you exert yourself?"
234,"Uh, it's it can happen like at anytime, but worse when I am exerting myself.",OK and then have you had a cough before?
235,"Uh. Not as frequently. I would say not really, it just started in the last two to three months.","OK, and have you had shortness of breath like this before?"
236,"Just throughout my life I've had asthma so when I am exercising too much or get exposed to like dust, sometimes get shortness of breath.","OK. Has there been anything, um besides exerting yourself, that's made that either the cough or or shortness of breath worse?"
237,"Uh, over the last year like I've had a couple of chest infections. After going to the ER, they gave me some antibiotics. But yeah, when that happens it usually gets worse. The shortness of breath and the cough.","OK, and uh, do your symptoms feel like any of those times right now?"
238,"No, I I don't feel like I have a fever and no other symptoms, just the shortness of breath and cough.","OK, and have you been doing anything that's made it better?"
239,"I've been taking some Tylenol Cold, hasn't really helped too much. I've tried my inhalers, they sometimes help, but I've never had have this frequent of coughing and shortness of breath before.","OK, um, and how has your energy been? Have you been experiencing fatigue?"
240,"Um, when it gets really bad then I can't really step out of the house, but other than that I feel like my energy's still there.","OK and you have it, have you had any fevers or chills?"
241,No.,"OK, how about at a loss of smell?"
242,No.,Um a loss of taste?
243,Nope.,"OK, and have you had any chest pain?"
244,"No, just sometimes when I'm like coughing a lot it gets a little bit uncomfortable. But other than that, no.","OK, um have you had any instances where you felt like your heart was racing?"
245,No.,"OK, how about being lightheaded or or like you were going to pass out?"
246,No.,"OK, have you had a runny nose or or a sore throat?"
247,Nope.,"OK, and how about headaches?"
248,No headaches.,"Alright, and have you had any wheezing?"
249,"Um, sometimes I've noticed it, but I had it before. Like with asthma as well, but not not that much.","OK, and how about abdominal pain?"
250,No abdominal pain.,"Alright, then any urinary problems?"
251,Nope.,Any bowel problems?
252,No.,Any rashes?
253,Nope.,"OK, and then how about any muscle aches or or joint aches or or body aches?"
254,"No, nothing like that.","Alright. And you mentioned asthma, but have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?"
255,"No, just asthma.","OK, and do you use inhalers? Are there any other medications you're currently using?"
256,"Oh no, just the salbutamol and like the steroid inhaler.","OK, yeah, and how often are you using both of those?"
257,So the steroid one I am using pretty much every day but the salbutamol I found I've been using a lot more recently. I would say probably at least six to 10 times in a week.,"OK, um that reminded me I I forgot to ask. Have you notice any changes to your voice?"
258,"Um no, not really.",OK um. And I was wondering if you had any allergies to medications?
259,"No, not that I know of.","Alright, and have you been in the hospital recently?"
260,No.,"Alright, so when was the last time that you had antibiotics?"
261,I would say like six months ago.,OK and any surgeries?
262,Nope.,"OK, and did you get the flu shot this year?"
263,Yep.,"OK, great um and I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation."
264,So I live in London um in a small apartment with my wife.,"OK, do you have any pets around?"
265,"No, no pets.","Alright, and um, any exposures at work too, like dust or any types of like chemicals like that."
266,"No, not really. My work is pretty much a desk job, so nothing like that.","OK, and do you smoke cigarettes?"
267,"Yeah yeah, I smoke a lot of cigarettes just like I would say 30 cigarettes a day.","OK, and how long have you smoked for?"
268,"I'd say, probably at least 25 years.","OK and sorry, could you remind me of your your age again?"
269,So I am 60 years old now.,"OK, so you started smoking um around 35."
270,Yeah yeah.,OK. Have you tried to quit?
271,"Yeah, tried to quit. I've even quite a couple times but then just got back onto it. Yeah, not not really ready to quit.","OK. That's fair enough. If there's something that you wanted to talk about quitting smoking at another appointment, we can arrange follow up for that."
272,Alright,Do you drink alcohol?
273,"Not much, just out say one or two beers on the weekend.","Alright, and you use any recreational drugs like cocaine, crystal meth, or IV drugs."
274,"No, nothing like that.","Alright, and has anything similar like this happened in your family before?"
275,"Uh, I think my um sister has a COPD, like she smokes a lot too. But that's that's about, I don't know if that's genetic.","Oh OK, um I. So I mean anybody in the family have cancers?"
276,"Um no, not that I know of.","Alright um so, that that was all the questions that I wanted to ask on history. Was there any, uh, any other questions that you had?"
277,"No, not really. Just wanted to get to the bottom of this.","OK for sure so um we will run some investigations and likely get a chest X Ray because it's been a couple of months that these symptoms have been going on for. But I think it could be related to your smoking and most likely um Bronc, chronic bronchitis, but we can definitely will be looking into this, and then also with possibly some pulmonary function tests as well."
278,"Yeah, so like a couple months ago I was in the office and they told me that I have asthma like I had it when I was a little kid and I thought I grew out of it, but apparently not, or like it came back or something so. Yeah, so they just told me to come back today. I don't really have like any issues.","OK, So what what brought on the appointment in the summer time or a couple of months ago?"
279,Uh. So like I have gym class at school and my teacher justalways thought that like should be able to run faster like I'm looking good athlete but I just couldn't go much faster and I was like saying I can't really breathe when I'm running that fast. And then you know my mom was like you should probably go. We should probably make an appointment.,"OK, and uh, when you're exercising or in gym class, do you get short of breath or do you find that you have difficulty breathing?"
280,"Yeah, yeah, like I will if I if I try to run fast. Like I, kinda can't breathe anymore. So I kind of stop or go slower.","OK, and how long does it take for the breathing difficulty to go away?"
281,"If I stop doing like the thing I'm doing it, I I don't know not very long like couple of minutes.","OK, and uh, does this happen in any other settings?"
282,"Oh, like sometimes when it's really cold outside, I'll go out and like it. My chest feels tight and just feel like I can't breathe and kind of sucks like my girlfriend wanted to build a snowman and do snow Angels and stuff and I couldn't do it. Oh, another time, like I went to my friends house and they had like a bunch of cats I I felt like I got wheezy sound and I felt like that time it took longer for for the breathing to get easier like I had to leave.","OK, so you've noticed changes to to your breathing sounds? Like you've had noisy breathing before?"
283,"Yeah, mostly just with the cat.",OK.
284,"We don't have a cat at my house, so I didn't really think anything of it. And then I went to my friends house who had a bunch of cats and. Then at that time, I could actually hear it.","OK, and have you had a cough?"
285,"Uh, no, I don't think so.","OK, And. Were there anything, was there anything that you tried besides the rest to make those symptoms go away?"
286,"Like I have the, uh um inhaler that the doctor gave me last time. So yeah, like I've been using it in gym class now.","OK, how many days per week are you using that?"
287,"Well, I'm a little confused now because. I the 1 supposed to use, like every day a couple times, and then there was a different one that I thought it was only supposed to be used if the other one didn't work. But now the nurse just told me that I'm supposed to use them both, so I only got the one at the pharmacy so I don't really I don't really know. I feel like a bit confused now, but I always use the 1 supposed to be like 2 times a day, the one that starts with an ""s"", um but sometimes I just do it once a day if I forget the second one.","OK, well um we can definitely clarify the confusion about the medications today. Sometimes, for steroid medications, those ones are required to be used daily in order to get the maximal benefit, and so will take a look at your medications and see if one of those has a steroid component in it and say and how often you're needing it. Have you been having any episodes of shortness of breath at night time?"
288,"Oh no. No, mostly like gym class like I said.",OK. And have you had any other associated symptoms?
289,Uh. I don't think so. Like what do you mean?,"Um, so anything like like allergies like runny nose or really itchy eyes with maybe some like um tearing?"
290,"When I was around the cats, yeah. But not the other times.",OK. And do you ever have any rashes on your skin or or really itchy skin?
291,When I was a kid but not really now.,"OK, and how about any nausea or vomiting?"
292,No.,OK. Any infectious symptoms overall?
293,"Ahh, I don't I don't think so.","OK, any urinary problems?"
294,"Uh, like. No, no.",OK. Bowel problems?
295,"uh no, no. No, that's all good.","OK um. And, uh, any fevers or chills?"
296,No.,"OK, and then how about, uh, have you been having any night sweats?"
297,What's that?,"So, uh, overnight when you're sleeping you wake up with either your like pajamas drenched, or your your sheets drenched drenched from sweating."
298,Oh no.,OK.
299,Um not that.,"OK. So I just wanted to ask a few questions about your past health. Have you been, so you mentioned asthma. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?"
300,"No, no that's it.","OK, um, and any recent hospitalizations?"
301,Like I broke my leg years ago but like that was just like really fast.,"OK, and any surgeries?"
302,Uh. Just like my wisdom teeth.,"OK, and any medications besides it like that, including the inhalers?"
303,"Nothing else, just. Just those things and my mom makes me take a vitamin.","OK, and any allergies?"
304,"What I don't know like not that I thought, but maybe like cats.","OK, and do you have any like seasonal allergies? Do you find like in the spring or fall time or even summer that you get um like dry eyes or really itchy"
305,"Yeah, I just thought like I had a cold, but I guess like I usually feel like that in the springtime.","OK. And, uh, are immunizations up to date?"
306,"I think so, like I've had all the stuff that I'm supposed to. I think I don't know the names of everything.","OK, and so I actually wanted to ask a few questions about personal and kind of lifestyle habits. But first I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation?"
307,"You know, like I live with my mom and Dad and I like my little brother.",OK.
308,Yeah.,"OK, and um, where do you go to school?"
309,"Um to to the. The school, um like high school down the road.",OK and in what grade now?
310,"And, I'm in Grade 11.","OK, and what types of like hobbies or kind of activities are you interested in?"
311,"I like I like playing video games, I was really wanting to join the Marines and I was really trying to get into that stuff, but then I heard like you can't when you have asthma. Oh so I I kinda wanna know bout that like is that gonna stop me from doing that?","Yeah, so it's something that we will look into today. I'm. I'm not too sure what the details are regarding that information, but thank you for bringing that up and we'll be for sure to look into that together. And that reminded me of a question I wanted to ask earlier and so have you had pulmonary function tests done before?"
312,"Uh, what is that?","So essentially they'll have you kind of breathing into a tube where you'll have periods where you'll maximally inhale and then maximally exhale as quickly as you can, and you'll do different types of breathing movements so that it gets measured on a on a device."
313,Is that like when you breathe in that the tube?,"Yeah, exactly."
314,"Yeah, like the last time I was here like couple months ago I did that and it said that, she said that my asthma was back.","OK. Right, thank you for clarifying. And so, so for the last few questions about. And your personal habits. I was wondering. I understand that people in your age group might experience with smoking or or alcohol. Do any of your friends do that?"
315,"I mean, sometimes we'll drink beer like at parties on the weekend. I don't, I don't drink a lot.","OK, and can you tell me a little bit about your diet?"
316,Sorry I missed that.,Just wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your diet?
317,"Oh, well my mom always like makes me a lunch like I'll have like a sandwich for lunch with like you know ham and cheese or something. I'll usually have like cereal for breakfast and my mom makes dinner. It's usually like meat like potatoes and vegetables or something. I think it's like pretty normal.","OK, and are you currently sexually active?"
318,"Uh. Like I have a girlfriend. Just with her. Uh, like just recently. Yeah we started.","OK, and do you use a condom?"
319,"Yeah, yeah.",Every time or sometimes?
320,"Oh yeah, every time. It's not doing that many times, but yeah.","OK, great and um have you had any other partners?"
321,"No, no like I had made out with other people before, but this is like the first one.","OK, but have you had a sexually transmitted infection before?"
322,Uh no.,"OK, and I know this question might seem a little bit invasive, but it's important to ask everybody. Have you had any thoughts of hurting or harming yourself?"
323,No.,OK.
324,No I haven't.,"OK, great um. And in your family, has anybody ever had any of these similar symptoms before?"
325,"Like may my dad, I think he maybe had asthma when he was younger, but like he doesn't really have it now.","OK, and any allergies that run in the family?"
326,"Mmmm, like my dad also really. Dad gets like a runny nose in the spring. So yeah, I think that's allergies.","OK. um. So overall, it's it's sounding like you been having this shortness of breath or difficulty breathing episodes that you're saying that it's made worse when you're exercising, out in the cold, and then around pets. And sometimes when the season changes as well and in the spring and so and then the recent diagnosis on pulmonary function tests a few months ago. So I think it would be important to clear up the medications today and try to get that better organized moving forward because it sounds like you're still pretty symptomatic with needing to use them daily currently. And so will look into that and then also the question about the Marines. Uh, interest with asthma."
327,"Yeah, thank you. I really wanna know that like that was my plan and now I'm like kinda worried I can do that.",Excellent.
328,"Yeah, so uh a couple of days ago. I just started to not feel so well and I've been having this cough and trouble breathing.","OK, um, have you ever had anything like this before?"
329,"I do have a, uh, cough regularly, but I mean, I, I think that's related to maybe smoking. It's something that was going on for a few years. This coughs a little bit different.","OK, in what way is this different?"
330,"It's been happening more often throughout the day and. And bringing up more more mucus, it seems like.","OK, and then you said it start started a couple days ago, is that correct?"
331,"Yeah, I think like Monday, so, uh, yeah I guess like 3 days ago then.","OK, and since you noticed it has it gotten worse over those three days."
332,"Yeah, I would say uh today's the worst day I've continually felt um sick.",OK. And how frequently are you coughing?
333,Uh I would say maybe a couple of times per hour. I'm I'm filling up a some tissues with sputum.,And what does that? What does that sputum look like?
334,It's like a dark greenish yellow colour.,"OK. OK, um and. Is there anything that you've changed recently in your life or any kind of things that have provoked your cough that you know of?"
335,"Ugh, no, I can't think of anything. I've been kind of sticking to my regular routines.","OK, and is there anything that makes, uh, makes it worse, say any position or anything that you do in your day to day routine you find makes you cough more?"
336,Um And not really I can't. I can't think of anything.,"OK. And, have you taken any any medicine or anything to try to help with us?"
337,"Um. No, I I've I I do have a little bit of pain so I was. I did take some Tylenol and some Advil over the last few days, but that's about it.","OK, Ok. Did you find that they helped at all?"
338,"A little bit yeah, but it would just kind of take the edge off of the pain for a little bit and it came back.",And what kind of pain is it that you're experiencing?
339,"Um, it's kind of a a sharp pain over on the like the right side of my chest like maybe belly area.","OK, OK um the right side of your chest and belly area. Yeah OK, so is that pain, is it, did it start around the same time as the cough?"
340,"Yeah, I think it, it might have started a little bit after.","OK, and is this a pain that you've ever had before?"
341,"No, I haven't had anything like this happen before.",OK. Is the pain primarily there when you cough or is it present at all times?
342,"I would say more so when I cough or if I'm like taking a big breath. Um yeah, kind of after after I have a coughing episode I take a deep breath and I really will feel the pain then.","OK, and and um, you said that it's a sharp pain?"
343,"Yeah, yeah, more of a sharp pain.","OK, OK, and is it any worse when you're doing activity, like when you're up and walking around?"
344,"No, don't notice it with any any activity.","OK. OK, um an since uh, since this coughing and this this right sided pain that you're talking about began, have you noticed any fevers?"
345,"I think, yeah, I've been hot the last few days and I I checked my temperature earlier today and it was like 38.6 so that was one of the reasons why I wanted to come in actually.","OK. OK, well I'm glad that I'm really glad that you came in because yeah, we really want to get this looked into. Have you been around anyone that's been sick recently?"
346,"No, but I I do some volunteer work at one of the homeless shelters at a few times a week, so I am around a lot of people.",OK. And have you traveled anywhere recently?
347,"No, I've been at home. And and doing the volunteer work.","OK um. OK, and can you just give me an idea of any? Do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for regularly or anything you take medication for?"
348,"Um yeah, I have type 2 diabetes. And I I take Metformin. Um I think an SGLT 2 inhibitor and then I use insulin for that as well. And I have some, it has affected my kidneys as well. The diabetes I mean.","OK, do you have a history of high blood pressure?"
349,I do yes.,"OK, do you take medication for that?"
350,"Oh yeah, I do. It starts with an ""a"" I think, amlodipine.",OK OK and do you have any history of heart problems?
351,"No, not that I know. No, I haven't really had any chest pain. On the left side anyway.","Um, So you said that you have had a cough for a really long time, a dryer cough then you're having sputum now. But is that something you've seen the doctor for?"
352,"Oh yeah, I think I was called like bronchitis in the past or something. Something like that. One of the doctors, my family doctor told me it was because I was a smoker.","OK. So just to make sure I have your list of medications, you take amlodipine, insulin"
353,"Um, and then yeah, amlodipine, uh, yeah, I think that that that's everything. Oh a multivitamin too.",OK cool. I just wanted to ask you a few questions questions about your lifestyle in general. Do you live here in town?
354,"I do. Yeah, I live with my wife and at a house nearby.","OK, cool and you mentioned that you're a smoker?"
355,"Yeah, so I've smoked for the last 30 years or so. About a pack per day.","OK, do you drink alcohol?"
356,"No, I don't.",Do you use any other substance?
357,"I don't, no.",Ok. And do you have any family history of respiratory or heart problems?
358,"Yeah, my dad actually had a heart attack. He was in his 70s. I think my mom had high blood pressure, but other than that, no.","OK, um and do you have any allergies?"
359,"I think just environmental stuff, no medications. I am aware of.","OK, OK. Well thank you for sharing all of that with me. I'm going to go over it with the physician that I'm working with and will kind of come back and let you know about the next steps."
360,Really I just don't I I don't feel quite right like I've had this pain in my chest for five days now and I've been just feeling kind of out of breath.,"Oh OK, um where are you feeling this pain?"
361,"Um, it's it's kind of um. On the left side of my chest and it's just like a tiny. It's like a lingering sharp pain. I don't really feel it anywhere else. It's just kind of there all the time right now. I I've never had anything like this before.","OK, so you're not feeling the pain radiate any to any other locations. You're just feeling it sort of in the one spot on the left side?"
362,"Yeah, yeah, exactly.","OK, and since this pain started 5 days ago, has it gotten any better, any worse, or stayed the same?"
363,"Like when I when it started I was just I was just like sitting on my couch. Um and now it's harder if I'm, it's worse if I'm walking around, like if I walk just down the street to get the mail. But otherwise it's kind of kind of just there, like I took some Tylenol and Advil, and they maybe take the edge off a little bit, but it's always there. And it's worse when I, when I take a deep breath then I really feel it.","OK, so it's worse. Is the pain worse when you're walking as well? Like out to get the mail?"
364,"It's I don't the the pain is, but I I'm not I can't catch my breath when I'm doing that.","OK, and how far could you usually walk, or um?"
365,"Oh yeah, usually walk before I go for long walks like every day, like probably like 5 kilometers or something.","OK, so prior to this happening you were feeling well?"
366,"Yeah, totally. I've not ever had any problems with my heart or lungs or anything. I thought it was maybe just like a chest infection. But I I don't know anymore.","OK, so you've had that, the difficulties breathing and the pain. And have you had any other symptoms?"

496,"Um, it's hard to say, I haven't really had this before. Um, it's more like it just kind of hurts just in the middle and it gets worse like when I cough and when I if I take like a really deep breath, it will hurt, yeah. Does that make sense?","Yeah, so the shortness of breath and chest pain, they occurred simultaneously right? On the same day, like 2 days ago?"
497,"Yeah, I mean now that I think of it, I maybe started coughing a little bit earlier than that. But when it got harder to breathe is pretty well around the same time that I started feeling more the pain.","OK, alright so let's focus on the coughing first. Are you coughing up any blood at all?"

I'm normally really active like I I train for triathlons and I I'm not like a couch potato, right? And I feel like I've been just kind of sitting down.","OK.

504,"Oh, like it kind of varies. I feel like I get up in the night kind of sweaty and I'll cough for for a while. And it it'll keep me up, and then during the day, it's like I might go, you know, a couple hours without, but then I'll cough and I'll kind of keep going for a few minutes so, it's a lot, like probably, yeah, I probably don't go more than like 2 hours without.","OK, OK. And how far can you walk before you start feeling shortness of breath?"
505,"I mean, I haven't been walking very far. Like I I walked in here from the parking lot and that was fine, but I'm tired.","OK, OK, and I just want to ask you some other questions. Um, Jessica, so have you had any fevers race recently?"

548,"Oh like if I'm like with friends, maybe on a weekend.",OK OK.
549,Couple drinks or something.,"OK, and have you been in contact with anyone who's been sick around you?"
550,"Like I said, I work I work from home so I've been seeing very many people. Um, I like I, geez. I my my sister, I saw my sister and like she, I guess she works she works in like a retirement home.",OK.
551,"Like she, I don't think she was sick.","OK. OK, is it possible that she was in contact with someone who may have been sick?"
552,"I think it's I mean it's possible like that's what she does for her work, right? She works at like a retirement home, so yeah possible.","OK, and what what kind of work do you do Jessica?"
553,I'm an accountant.,"OK, and have you traveled anywhere recently? I know with COVID obviously that's hard."
554,"I wish I wish, but you know I haven't been anywhere. Like I said, I've just been at home.","OK. Um, in particular, have you been in a country where TB is endemic and have you been in any of those countries in the past, like 5 to 10 years?"
555,"I don't know like I've been to the like the states before COVID. I I don't, I didn't really haven't traveled anywhere cool in a long time.","OK, OK. Um, so just kind of going through what it could be that you have right now. I'm thinking"
556,"OK, yeah hopefully.","An infection would be the biggest one right now with the cough with it seems like you have chills and night sweats. Yeah, so would have to do more in terms of taking your temperature, and see if you can do like more"
557,"See I never come in besides like because I you know need my insulin. I never even go to the, I didn't even want to come in and just like it wasn't going away.","Yeah yeah. And then other things like COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and like like cancer stuff is super"
558,"I don't think I don't think so, um yeah, I just hope I can get feeling better. Hope it's not anything serious like I I think yeah, I just hope it's like I hope like you said it's like I got like an infection or something and it will just be gone soon.","Yeah yeah it does sound like it from the timeline like you started coughing two days ago, and then the difficulty breathing or shortness of breath also two days ago and then the chest pain just seems like it's from you coughing a lot."
559,It can do that?,Yeah.
560,"OK, yeah.","Yeah, OK, so I guess we will see you at our follow up and after all of these investigations are done."
561,I'm I'm 50 I'm gonna be 50 soon.,"OK, OK, when did this start?"
562,"Well, like last night I kinda had like an ache on my chest, kind of like here like on the left. I just I didn't do anything really last night and you know I just went to sleep and I got to sleep fine like I just thought maybe I pulled a muscle on this side. But then I woke up and I was like walking up the stairs and I like was kinda having a hard time breathing and I took some Tylenol. It didn't really do anything. Um, and then it just got worse and then a few hours ago is like I could barely walk. And if I'm breathing deep it's like it just hurts. And I feel like I can't like catch my breath like I can't get a good like a good breath in.","Um, OK, so I just want to state at this point I would do ABC's, like I would do the vitals and make sure you're stable and then do airway breathing circulation if you weren't before I continue with the history. OK, so. OK, so that's how it started. Um, are you having any chest pain at all associated with that?"
563,"Like when I breathe in, I get like and it's like an ache. And then if I breathe really deep it feels like a little sharp.",OK.
564,I have never had anything like this before.,"No? OK, that was going to be my next question. On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe is your shortness of breath, 10 being the worst?"
565,"Um, I don't, I don't know, um. Like I can breathe right now, I can't get like a deep breath, like...","Does it? Oh sorry, go ahead."
566,Maybe like you know five or six.,"OK, OK. Does it hurt when you take a deep breath in?"
567,Yeah.,Yeah?
568,"Yeah, it's like it's like sharp.","OK, sorry, sounds like you're having some pleuritic chest pain. Do you have any coughing associated with that?"
569,No no.,No? You're not coughing up any blood?
570,No.,Any swelling in your legs?
571,I I don't think so.,"No? OK, how about on exertion? Like when you walk or run, or you know, does it hurt more or does I mean sorry, does your shortness of breath get worse?"
572,"Oh yeah, it was like going up the stairs, can't really breathe in after.","OK, how about when you're laying down?"
573,"I don't know. I don't think that's any different. No, I slept fine last night. I got up and when I went up the stairs I was like holy...",OK. How about wheezing? Are you experiencing any wheezing?
574,I don't think so.,"OK, how about fevers or chills?"
575,"No, not that I've noticed, no.",OK. Any abdominal pain?
576,"Uh, no, no, it's like it aches kind of it, but it's all up here and like kind of in my back a little bit.","OK and, do you think anything triggered this?"
577,I don't know.,"No? OK. And you said this has never happened to you before, right?"
578,"Right, yeah.",Does it get better with you sitting forward?
579,"I don't know, like I, I feel like that it's still kind of aching like it doesn't, it's not really like changing very much.","OK. OK. OK, any changes in your vision, hearing or smell?"
580,No.,No? Any rashes?
581,No.,No? Weight loss?
582,"I, I mean, I've been trying to to lose weight.",OK.
583,They told me a year ago I have like high blood pressure so I've been cutting out like salt and trying to walk more.,"OK, OK, good."
584,So I've lost like 15 pounds but like not... Like I've been trying to.,"OK, OK. 15 pounds, that's good. Are you experiencing any dizziness or you feeling faint?"
585,"No, just like a I can't get like a good breath.","OK, and are you otherwise healthy? You mentioned you have high blood pressure, anything else?"
586,"No, that's that's like it. I've never had any like chest problems.","OK. Have you had any investigations done for your chest like pulmonary function tests, ECG's, chest X-rays?"
587,"No, no, they just they just put the thing on my arm. But my doctors office and said that it was high. So they said to you know, eat better and I don't I don't wanna start any drugs so, I didn't do anything. I've been fine ever since.","OK, so you're not on any medications?"
588,"No, just yeah, no that's it. I mean I, you know sometimes take like a Tylenol if I'm",And do you smoke?
589,"I, like I, smoke a little bit. Maybe like a pack a week.","A pack a week, OK? For how long?"
590,Oh like since college.,"OK OK. Um, do you smoke marijuana?"
591,"Uh. No, no and I I smoke, I'm trying to smoke less, you know, since they told me I have the high blood pressure. So I used to smoke a little more but this is this is less but not since I've been having trouble breathing. Is it, yeah.","Yeah, OK. Any other recreational drugs?"
592,No no.,"No, OK. How about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol?"
593,"Oh like, maybe you know, a beer on the weekend.","OK, and are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
594,Like I don't I think I got all the ones when I was like a kid. What else should I have?,"OK, so like the flu vaccine every year?"
595,"Oh, I get that, like my wife, my wife makes me get that.",OK that's good. Any family history of lung or heart disease?
596,"Oh like my, uh, my mom and dad have high blood pressure too, so I wasn't surprised when I heard that I did.","OK. OK. Um, OK so Rob, is there anything that you wanted to tell me that I haven't asked you already today?"
597,"I am really like nervous 'cause I haven't felt anything like this before. Um, like it's scary, like do you think it's like cancer or something like I don't I don't really know?","Um, I mean, it's hard to tell right now what it is. It sounds like it's it started pretty suddenly, um, like it started a day ago, correct?"
598,Mhm.,"Yeah, so it's unlikely that cancer would present itself like this so acutely, you know? And, but it could it could be a number of things like, it could be something like a pulmonary embolism, but you said you don't have any swelling. Um, but you did say you have some chest pain when you're breathing pretty, when you take a deep breath in. So I mean, that's a possibility. It doesn't sound like it's an infection because you don't have a fever or chills or any any other symptom really. And you mentioned there weren't any triggers like no trauma to the area. And then, other things could be like COPD because you which is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease because you have been smoking since college and that's basically just inflammation in your lungs that causes your airways to narrow, and so you may have a hard time breathing. So for all of these things, we first start by doing some blood work and then we'll do some imaging like a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test if indicated, and so that will give us a better idea of what you have and how we can best help you. Sounds good?"
599,"Yeah yeah, I just really want to get a good breath so yeah, whatever we can do.","Yeah for sure, and then in the meantime we'll keep monitoring you to make sure your vitals are OK and if we need to give you oxygen, we will."
600,That'd be great.,"OK, thank you."
601,"This afternoon, I'm just here because I've been experiencing some breathlessness as well as a bit of cough.","OK, when did it start?"
602,So I think it's a it started around three months ago and I believe it's just been getting worse.,"OK. Um, how often are you experiencing the shortness of breath?"
603,"I feel it like a lot of the time, especially outside when I'm in the cold or at at night when I go outside at night, my chest feels a little tight too at the same time.","OK, and how long does it last?"
604,I would say it lasts up to an hour every time I'm out in the cold and then once I come back in. So I'd say it lasts at least one hour.,"OK, does anything else make it worse, like dust? You know, laying down anything like that?"
605,"Sometimes when I'm near dust, sometimes when I'm running during gym class, increased activity does make it worse.","OK, OK. And if you were to describe the quality of your breathing difficulties, is it more like a burning kind of feeling? Is it like you can't catch your breath? What does it feel like?"
606,I think it's more just a I can't catch my breath and it feels like my my throat is just kind of like closing off and I can't take deep breaths.,"OK, yeah, that's scary. And one to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is your shortness of breath?"
607,"It can get up to I would say like an 8 at times. It can get pretty scary. And sometimes, like I feel like heaviness in my chest too when it happens.","Yeah, and the coughing, has it been going on for as long as your breathlessness?"
608,"I would say around the same same time frame like 3 months, but I'm not always coughing. It comes and goes.","OK, and for your coughing, is it kind of like the same triggers, the cold, dust, things like that?"
609,"Yeah, I would say so.",And do you ever have do you ever cough up blood?
610,"No, I don't. It's mostly just a dry cough. I don't cough up anything.","OK so no sputum or phlegm, no? OK, do you ever feel wheezy?"
611,"I I I do hear like a like a weird sound when I breathe out sometimes, I I think it might be wheeziness.","OK, OK. Do you have a sore throat?"
612,"Uh, no I don't have a sore throat, no.","No? Um, how about a runny nose or stuffy nose?"
613,"No, nothing like that.",Any changes in your smell?
614,"No, no changes in my smell, no.",OK. How about hearing?
615,"Uh, no hearing is fine.","OK and like no pus or liquid's coming out of your ear or anything like that, right?"
616,No.,No ear pain?
617,No.,"OK, and how about your vision, everything OK there?"
618,"Yeah, everything is OK.","OK, any fevers?"
619,"I don't know about a fever, I haven't checked, but some nights I do, especially in the last week I have woken up feeling a bit chilly. I haven't really checked.","OK, so you woke up feeling chilly, any night sweats?"
620,Uh no.,"OK, any weight loss?"
621,No no.,How about changes in your skin? Like have you noticed a rash anywhere?
622,"Uh, not that I've really noticed no, no rashes.",OK and any chest pain at all?
623,"No, just sometimes when I I'm coughing a lot I feel a little bit of just tension and heaviness in there. But that's just when I'm like really coughing a lot.","Yeah OK, and any any feelings like your heart's racing?"
624,Nope.,No? OK. And how about swelling? Have you noticed swelling anywhere in your body?
625,"No, nothing like that.","No? OK um, OK, how about um, does your shortness of breath get worse when you're falling asleep?"
626,"No, nothing like that. I think it's mainly just worse if I go out in the cold or I'm like running around, doing more activities.",Does it ever wake you up at night?
627,No never.,OK and any nausea or vomiting?
628,"No, no nausea or vomitting.","OK, how about changes in your in your bowel movement?"
629,"No, bowel movements are normal.","How about in terms of urinating, any changes there?"
630,No no.,OK any headaches?
631,No.,No? Any dizziness or fainting spells?
632,No.,"Confusion, memory loss?"
633,"No, nothing like that.","OK, good are you otherwise healthy?"
634,"Yeah, I don't have any other condition, I I do remember my doctors saying I have hay fever before, but that's about it.",When was that?
635,I think that was like more than three years ago.,"OK, um, any recent surgeries?"
636,No.,No? Are you on any medications?
637,"I just take some Tylenol sometimes for the like Tylenol cold, sometimes for the symptoms. I don't think it has really helped.","No? OK, do you have any allergies? Not just to medications, but to anything else?"
638,"Uh just like hay fever but nothing, nothing else that I can think of, no.","OK. Um, are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
639,"As far as I know, yeah everything's up to date.","OK, any family history of lung conditions?"
640,"Uh, don't think so. My sister, I think she they were saying she might have asthma and she also has eczema. No one else in the family has any other conditions.","Not not even like heart conditions, cancer?"
641,"No, uh no, not that I know.","OK, OK, have you been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?"
642,No.,"No, OK, and any travel recently?"
643,"No, I've been here in Ontario.","OK, and where do you live?"
644,"So I currently live in London, but I just recently moved into a new flat around two months ago.","Two months ago, OK. Um, is it more is it an older flat?"
645,"Uh, no, it's fairly new. But one thing I did notice, I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but my flatmate actually smokes. Sometimes that can really irritate and make me cough more sometimes at night.","Yeah, any any pets?"
646,"Oh no, I don't have any pets.",OK and and do you smoke?
647,"No, I don't smoke, no.",OK. And do you smoke marijuana?
648,"Nope, never tried marijuana.","OK, any recreational drugs?"
649,"No, I don't smoke marijuana or cigarettes.","OK, how about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol?"
650,"Um, just like, maybe sometimes at parties, but very rarely. Maybe I would say once a month.","OK, OK. Um, and is there anything that you wanted to discuss today that I missed?"
651,"Uh, so no, I think that that was all like just the shortness of breath was scaring me a lot. But yeah, just the coughing, but other than that I just want to know what's going on.","OK, yeah, and you mentioned you are otherwise healthy so you don't have any history of asthma or anything like that, right?"
652,"No, no ones ever told me that, but my sister has asthma, so I was wondering, maybe?","Um, have you ever experienced shortness of breath when you were younger with like exercise?"
653,"Uh, not really. Just maybe like the normal amount. Like if I'm running around too much, I feel shortness of breath, but I think it just got worse over the last few months.",OK and then have you ever had any imaging done in the past like a chest X-Ray or investigations like a pulmonary function test?
654,"No, I don't recall having any of that done.","OK alright well those are all the questions I had for you. If you didn't have anything else to add, I guess we will conclude by saying that what you have, we have a differential diagnosis for this. Um, it sounds like what you have is asthma. Since your symptoms started three months ago when you moved into a flat with your friends, and it seems like this smoking and cold is triggering that and so we'll work you up with a pulmonary function test to start and we'll see if bronchodilators will help with your symptoms. And if it doesn't, we'll also rule out other things like pneumonia or like allergic rhinitis. How does that sound?"
655,"Yeah, that sounds good.","OK, sounds great. Well, we'll see you soon then."
656,"Alright, thank you.",Take care.
657,"So I've been having just a worsening breathlessness. I've been also having a cough, and I think I might have also had a fever in the last couple weeks.","OK, um so the breathlessness started six weeks ago, correct?"
658,Yeah.,OK and then when did the cough start?
659,"I'd say around the same time the breathlessness started, so around six weeks.",OK. And then the fever?
660,The fever I've kind of had on and off in the last couple weeks. I would say two to three weeks.,"OK, OK um and do you, how often are you having this breathlessness?"
661,"Um I would say it's pretty much there most of the time. It sometimes gets worse when I'm exerting myself, but I think just baseline, I feel like I've been able to breathe less heavily than before.","OK, so alright, and how long does it last when you do get it? Or is it just always there?"
662,"Uh, it's kind of just there, but then when it's getting worse like it lasts a couple minutes to, I would say like 10 to 15 minutes and then it goes back to like just the normal breathlessness.","OK, and if you were to describe the quality of your breathlessness, would you say that it feels like a kind of like a burning feeling, like you're having a hard time catching your breath or does it feel like you're breathing too fast?"
663,"I think it's more I just can't seem to take like deep breaths. And then when I get breathless, I I really try to take a deep breath but I just can't find myself catching my breath at that time. So it's just more not being able to catch my breath.","OK, sure. And are there things that make make it better or worse?"
664,"Uh, not really, I think it's sometimes moving around too much, but like nothing, nothing really causes it.","OK, um, and was there any sort of trigger six weeks ago that you think may have like caused all of your symptoms?"
665,Oh I'm not sure I I don't think there was any triggers.,"OK, has anyone around you been sick?"
666,So there there are some people living in my house that have a bad cough over the last few weeks.,OK.
667,So yeah.,So they have similar symptoms to you as well then?
668,"Yeah, some of them like don't really have the shortness of breath and it's just like a cough.",OK.
669,"But yeah, there are some of them also have some shortness of breath.","OK, OK. And have you traveled anywhere recently?"
670,So I actually came to Canada one year ago. I'm originally from India and I I'm I came here to study.,"OK. OK, um alright. If you were to rate your breathlessness from one to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is your breathlessness?"
671,"It can get pretty bad. Like I I would say up to an 8 sometimes, maybe a couple times a week.","OK, and have you ever experienced this before?"
672,"No, this is like the first time I'm having this issue.","OK, and do you feel like it's getting worse, better, has it changed since you started having these symptoms?"
673,I think it's getting worse and that's why I was getting a bit scared and I came here.,"OK. Yeah, that was a good call and have you had any changes to your smell recently?"
674,"No, no changes to smell.",Any anything like a runny nose or stuffy nose?
675,"Uh, no, not really, no.","No? OK, how about a sore throat?"
676,"No, no sore throat.","No sore throat, any changes to your taste?"
677,Nope.,Any changes in hearing?
678,Nope.,Ear pain or discharge from your ears?
679,"No, nothing like that.","OK, any eye pain?"
680,No.,Changes in your vision?
681,Nope.,Any discharge from your eyes?
682,Nope.,"OK, and you mentioned fever and some night sweats. How often are you getting these night sweats and do they feel like chills?"
683,"I think in the last two weeks I've been getting it more frequently, like I would say every other night I I feel, I would feel chilly at one point and then I'll break out into night sweats or have to take off my blanket. I think I measured it once or twice over the week and it did show like a fever of 102.","OK, OK. OK, and any changes to your skin like rashes?"
684,"No, nothing like that.",Any weight loss?
685,"I would say I think I'm losing a little bit of weight over the last couple weeks. I haven't really weighed myself, but I feel that I have lost some weight.","OK yeah, and the coughing, are you coughing up any blood?"
686,"Uh, I don't think so. Sometimes, like when I cough up like sputum, there is like a little bit of pink, pink tinged sputum as well. Sometimes it's like brownish in color and sometimes it's green, but I haven't actually coughed up any blood.","OK, um and you said there's some sputum like pink tinged sputum. How much sputum would you say you cough up every time you cough?"
687,Maybe like a like a spoonful I would say.,OK. And do you ever feel like you're wheezing?
688,"Uh, no, I I don't think so. I I don't really notice any noises when I'm breathing.","OK. And, alright, so any chest pain?"
689,"No, no chest pain at all.",OK. How about swelling in your legs or in your limbs?
690,"No, no swell leg swelling.","No leg swelling? OK, um how about do you feeling like your heart's racing?"
691,No.,"No OK. OK, and any nausea or vomiting?"
692,"No, no nausea or vomitting.",How about changes in your bowel movements?
693,No.,"OK, how about changes in urinating?"
694,"No, it's been fine.",Alright any headaches?
695,No headaches.,Any dizziness or fainting spells?
696,"No, nothing like that.","OK, no confusion or memory loss?"
697,No.,"OK, and are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any medical conditions?"
698,"Um I think when I was back in India a couple years ago, they did give me some antibiotics for like a chest infection, but I couldn't really afford the medications and didn't take them. I didn't finish the course, but other than that, nothing else.","OK, did they mention what type of chest infection it could've been?"
699,"No, I don't really remember. I think it was some kind of pneumonia.","OK, OK. Are you on any medications?"
700,"Just uh I take Tylenol sometimes, like it hasn't really been helping.","OK. And, are you allergic to anything?"
701,"No, not that I know.","OK, are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
702,"Yeah, as far as I know.",OK. And and is there any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?
703,Nope.,"No OK, how about cancers?"
704,"No cancers that run in the family, no.","OK OK, so you mentioned you moved to Canada from India about a year back. Where do you live now?"
705,"So I live in it's, we have like a student house with some of the students who came from India as well, and there's six of us living together in in a house.","OK, OK, and are they sick as well or no?"
706,"Yeah, so three of them actually have like, two of them have a cough and one of them has some shortness of breath as well.",OK. And have they been to a doctor? Have they been investigated? Were they ever given a diagnosis?
707,"No, not that I know of. I think I might be the first one who actually went to a doctor.","OK, OK. Um, do you smoke?"
708,I smoke like I would say like 5 cigarettes a day.,"OK, how long have you been smoking for?"
709,Around 10 years.,"OK, that's, it's been a while then. Um, and do you do you drink alcohol?"
710,"No, I I don't drink and I don't do any drugs either.","OK, OK. Are you sexually active?"
711,"Not currently, no.","No, OK. Have you ever had unprotected sex?"
712,No.,"No?, OK. OK, um, did you have any questions or concerns? Anything you wanted to discuss that I hadn't asked you about?"
713,"Um, so yeah, this is just like my first time visiting a doctor in this country and like I was just very scared that it might be something serious, so just wanted to know what it can be.","Yeah, for sure. So the first thing we want to rule out is TB. Because you have recently moved to Canada from a country where it is, I believe it is endemic, so and some of your most of your symptoms fit with TB and how it presents so we just want to make sure it's not that because it is highly infectious and and we don't want it to spread. So, we can do like a AFB smear or I think they have other diagnostic work up for that too. So we'll do that first. If not, we can check to see if it's like another, another typical pneumonia, we can do a chest X Ray for that as well. If both of those turn out to be negatives, then we'll have to work you up further for other things, like COPD, or lung cancer. How does that sound?"
714,Not so well I I feel like I've been having just worsening breathlessness and a cough for it's been going on for two years now and I just can't seem to get rid of it.,"OK, the cough and breathlessness both started two years ago?"
715,"Yeah, I would say approximately around the same time.","OK, OK. Um, do you always have the breathlessness, or does it come and go?"
716,"Um, I think it's, I feel short of breath most of the times, but it's mainly just gets worse when I'm exerting myself when I'm walking more than usual or just working in the garden.","OK, OK, um and same thing with the cough? It gets worse when you're walking around?"
717,"Yeah, I would say so.",OK. And was there any sort of trigger for this two years ago? Anything that you remember?
718,"Um, no, it kind of just started gradually on its own. No, no real triggers that I can remember.","OK, and, does anything make it worse or better besides the exertion?"
719,"Uh, no, I think that's pretty much the only thing that really makes it worse.","OK, and how would you describe your breathlessness? Is it that you're breathing too fast or you can't catch your breath?"
720,It's I think it's more so just I can't catch my breath and sometimes I just have trouble being able to take like a full breath.,"OK, OK. Um, and out of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is your breathlessness?"
721,It can get up to I would say like an eight sometimes when I'm doing a lot of work.,"OK, and have you ever experienced this before?"
722,"Not before the two years, before I I never felt anything like that.","OK, and you mentioned it's gradually been getting worse, right?"
723,"Yeah, I would say so.","OK, and the cough, um, do you ever cough up any blood?"
724,"No, it's uh, it's usually just a dry cough. No, no I don't produce any mucus or blood.","OK. OK. Um, and do you feel like you're wheezy?"
725,"No, I haven't heard any kind of wheeziness at all.",OK. Any issues with your breathlessness when you're laying down?

762,"No, not that I know.","No um, and have you traveled anywhere recently?"
763,"No, No.","OK, um, have you been worked up for this in the past two years? Like have you had any chest X-rays or pulmonary function tests or anything like that?"
764,"No, I've never really had this issue before, so no investigations.","OK, OK, well those were all the questions that I had. Did you have anything that you wanted to add that I maybe missed?"
765,"Uh, no, I just it's been going on for two years and I feel like it's getting worse and worse. And yeah, I'm just scared of having to, you know, go on oxygen or like just not being able to breathe at one point.","Yeah, for sure. So we will try to do a good job working you up for everything that we think it may be. And right now, it sounds like it could be pulmonary fibrosis either like you know an autoimmune process or triggered after like an infection that you may have had in the past. We will definitely also look into see if it's perhaps a lung cancer, asthma and you mentioned you don't smoke so we don't think it could be COPD but we'll also test for that in case all everything else comes back negative."
766,"OK, sounds good. Thank you so much.",Thank you. Take care you too.
767,"No, it's completely dry. I can't bring anything up.","OK, and since the cough started, has it been getting getting worse, staying the same, getting any better?"
768,"It was pretty much the same for I would say like three or four months, but then I've noticed it getting more frequent over the last couple of months.","OK, and six months ago, can you think of anything that that changed? Including like, traveling anywhere or changing in in your work or or living environment?"
769,"Uh, not really, uh, I'm like almost 75 years old now, so I just thought it was probably just due to my age.","OK. Uh, have you been have you brought up any blood with the cough?"
770,"No, I've never brought up any blood.","OK, and have you have had any shortness of breath?"
771,"Not that I've noticed, but I do find that I get a little bit more tired with exercise than I used to, but not really any shortness of breath.","OK. Um, and have you been experiencing any other symptoms?"
772,"I don't know if this is just due to old age, but like I've noticed some joint pain as well, like in my hands and feet. I just assumed that was 'cause I'm getting old.","OK um, and has there been anything that's made the cough worse?"
773,"Sometimes when, I'm exercising a lot more but not not too much, it's kind of just always been there, hasn't really changed too much, but it's gotten more frequent over the last couple of months.","OK, and anything that's made the cough better that you've tried?"
774,"No, nothing I've tried like everything. I've tried Tylenol cold, I've tried other home remedies but like like steaming and everything like that but nothing has really helped.","OK, and is the cough worse in the morning, throughout the day or or at night?"
775,It's pretty much always there. It doesn't really change with any time of the day.,"OK, and is the cough interfering with sleep?"
776,"Yeah, I sometimes I I do have coughing fits at night that wake me up. I do have","OK. Um and, you mentioned some joint pains as well and then when did that those start?"
777,I would say over the last year is when I started noticing it a lot more than before.,"OK, have you been having joint stiffness or or muscle stiffness early in the morning?"
778,"It does get a little bit more stiff in the morning, but it's kind of just there throughout the day.","OK, have you noticed any red hot or or kind of swollen joints?"

780,"No, not that I know of, nope.","OK, um, and how has your energy been? Have you been experiencing a lot of fatigue?"
781,"Yeah, I definitely have been more tired. I can't really even go outside for a walk sometimes or I get really tired working in the garden. So it's been tough.","OK, and when did that when did you notice that change and and how were you different before?"
782,"Like before, like before six months ago, I remember I used to be able to go for long walks around the block, then when I was gardening I can go on for hours, but now I'm pretty it's pretty limited to like maybe 15-20 minutes and then I have to go back into the house.","I see OK, so pretty big difference over the last six months to a year for you."
783,Yeah.,Have you been experiencing any fevers or chills?
784,Not really. Not that I know of.,"OK, how about, uh, excessive sweating at night?"

795,"No, not really.","OK, and have you noticed any swelling in your limbs, like in your hands and your feet or ankles?"
796,"No, not really.","Alright at night, have you had any periods where you woke up extremely short of breath and you had to sit on the edge of the bed with your feet over?"
797,"No, not that I remember.","OK, and how many pillows do you sleep with?"
798,"Just one, same as before.","OK, um and any abdominal pain?"
799,"No, no pain is just in my joints and sometimes in my muscles, but other than that, no.","OK, any urinary problems like pain or or going really often?"

803,"I would say like my legs and arms. It's it's pretty much  lot of the joints, not really affecting my hip, but like everything else seems a bit sore.","OK, and, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?"
804,"No, never. I've been pretty fortunate.","OK, so do you take any medications either prescription or over the counter?"

809,No I've been at home.,"OK um and in the family, have you heard of anything like this happening in the family sort of way, onset of this kind of shortness of breath and cough that you've been experiencing?"
810,"Not really, I I don't really have shortness of breath like it's it's like a dry cough. Sometimes I do find myself breathing more shallow. Yeah, mostly it's just a dry cough that's been going on.","OK, and more of the fatigue."
811,Yeah.,OK. And anybody in the family have like autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or or lupus?
812,"Uh I don't really, I can't really think of nothing my mom and dad were completely healthy. So I know and I don't have any siblings, so yeah, not nothing that I know of.","OK, uh, any cancers in the family like colon cancer or anything like that?"
813,"No, no cancers.","OK. Um, and could you tell me a little bit about your living situation?"
814,"Yeah, so right now I live alone in a small townhouse and yeah, that's I have a pet dog, but that's that's about it.","OK, um, and how do you support yourself financially?"
815,"So, I'm retired, but getting a pretty good pension as well as for my a husband's pension as well, but he unfortunately passed away a couple years ago.","I'm sorry to hear that. What did you say you retired, what did you do for work previously? Did you have any exposures to chemicals or asbestos products while while at work?"
816,"Not that I remember, no it was it was a pretty, pretty much like a desk job I would say.","OK um, so no reasons that you were visiting farms and like being around birds or anything like that?"
817,"Um, not really, but I I do think like the old building that we lived in might have had asbestos. Does that does that like count at all?","Like a it could be important, uh, because, uh, well how long, how long did you live there for?"
818,I would say almost 20 years.,"OK, so um, yes, that definitely would be is is important for the history today because, unfortunately, long term exposure to asbestos when breathing it in can cause some of the symptoms that you've been describing along with cough and uh, respiratory symptoms. So it'll be something that we'll be sure to investigate today, OK? But I just had a couple more questions. First, do you smoke cigarettes?"
819,"I quit long time ago, more than like 10 years ago, but I used to smoke like 5 to 10 cigarettes for around 20 years.","OK, and do you smoke cannabis?"
820,No.,"Alright, do you drink alcohol?"
821,"No, not anymore.","OK, and do you use any other recreational drugs?"
822,No.,"Alright, and are you currently sexually active?"
823,No.,"Alright, and have you had a sexually transmitted infection before?"
824,No.,"OK, so those are the questions that I wanted to go over to make sure I asked on history. Was there anything that else you wanted to tell me?"
825,"No, I think that's all.","OK, so next we'll do your physical exam and order some investigations. But currently thinking that it could be related to asbestos exposure as well as um, something called, well, it could cause pulmonary fibrosis and then also the joint pains that you've been experiencing might be another symptom that is suggestive of a connective tissue disease, and it doesn't sound like you have a family history of those, but we will do some lab work and investigations for for those including a chest X-Ray and a chest CT."
826,"No, not really. It's been pretty much like a dry cough. I did feel like a tickle in my throat before it started, but no, I'm not producing any phlegm.","OK, um is the cough any worse at any particular time of day, like when you first get up or or at night when going to bed?"
827,"No, it's pretty much just been there over the last, at least like 2 days. It's been getting worse, more frequent.","OK, so um and are you coughing all throughout the day?"
828,"Pretty much, at least for the last few days. Just it's been pretty nonstop.","OK, anything that's made the cough worse?"
829,"Uh, no, not really. It's uh, pretty much been the same for the last few days.",Anything you've tried to make the cough go away?
830,"Just like Tylenol cold. And then I think there was another over the counter medication that I took, but nothing really helping.","OK and uh, the cough has been been getting worse. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?"
831,"Um, I did just just last night, actually. I thought that I had some shortness of breath as well. I don't know if that's being caused by all the coughing, but yeah, I got pretty scared, so that's why I'm here today.","OK, um has anything like this happened to you before?"
832,"No, like I've been pretty healthy otherwise completely so this is this is completely new for me.","Ok, and yeah, you mentioned you had a fever but did have you checked your temperature?"

836,"No, not really. I did have like a I don't know if it was soreness, but just like a tickle in my throat just a few days back before the coughing started.","OK, yeah. And have you had any loss of smell or or loss of taste?"
837,"Yeah, now that I think of it, I I I I can't I can barely taste taste the food that I'm eating. I don't know about smell I I'm pretty stuff stuff stuffy right now so that might just be because of that. I definitely notice I can't really taste my food.","Alright. Uh, and uh, have you been having any wheezing?"
838,"No, no wheezing.","Alright, and shortness of breath, were you at rest when that that happened or were you exercising or exerting yourself? What, how did the shortness of breath come on?"
839,"I was actually just laying down and I was sleeping and I just noticed that I couldn't really take deep breaths, so I kind of just got back up and it was just during last night. It hasn't happened after that, but I'm scared it will happen again.","OK, and have you, how many pillows do you usually sleep with?"
840,Just one.,Have you noticed any swelling in your feet or ankles?

872,No.,"OK, and then how about so any cancers in the family?"
873,I think I've had an aunt who had breast cancer but nothing else.,"OK, um, so those are all the questions I wanted to go go through on history. I am concerned that you might might have COVID-19 or coronavirus. And so it could be COVID, or this could be another viral infection or possibly pneumonia going on. But it does sound like you have an infection and so we'll check some sputum cultures. And and we'll also do a PCR nasal swab testing for COVID. So we'll go ahead and order those tests and we'll see what their their results say."
874,"Sure, you know I've been feeling kinda hot for the past couple of days and I have this terrible, terrible headache. And just my brain feels foggy. So I thought I should come get it checked out.","OK, I see when uh did these symptoms start exactly?"

912,"Oh sorry, yes. Just the birth control pills.","Yeah OK, no worries, and any allergies?"
913,Just seasonal allergies.,"OK, and so are immunizations up to date?"
914,"Yep, they are.","Alright, and in in the home, is there anybody who's sick right now?"
915,"No, no one is sick.","Ok, how about at work?"

921,I do.,"OK, so for one of the Ontario stores?"
922,Yes.,"OK great yeah 'cause you could never be sure where else, what the dosing is, so it's good to get it from the appropriate stores for sure."
923,Right.,Do you drink alcohol?
924,"I do, I'll have a glass of wine with dinner.",OK is this daily?
925,"Um most days I would say, maybe like four or five days of the seven days of the week.","OK, I see. And has anybody in your family had similar symptoms in the past to what you're having or had any lung conditions in the past?"
926,"No, nothing like that.","OK, how about any heart conditions?"
927,"Um, my father passed away at 75 from a heart attack.","OK, and uh, how about any cancers in the family?"
928,None that I know of.,"OK. So I think that was, uh, all of the questions that I wanted to ask on history today. Was there anything else that you thought I was missing or that you wanted to tell me about?"
929,"No, I don't think so. But, uh, what do you think I have?","So with the acuity of your symptoms, starting with the last few days and getting worse, especially with a fever which we now have documented of 38.8 and a kind of feeling, uh, tired with aches and pains and the headache, I am concerned that you have possibly a viral infection, and one of those possibilities could be COVID-19, but also it could be the influenza. It could be something like the common cold, such as adenovirus. So certainly we will do a PCR COVID swab as well as order some general lab work to look for signs of infection, such as a CBC and a white blood cell count.

I don't, and sometimes especially people in your age group who have diabetes can have chest pain and symptoms that could be nonspecific. And so we will, we will check that for sure. We'll get an ECG and some lab work with the troponin and also a chest X Ray so that we can investigate for that. And also the chest X Ray could help us look to see if you have something going on in your lungs, like a possible pneumonia or, maybe a viral infection as well, which could include something like COVID-19. So we'll be ordering a PCR nasal swab as well to test for that. And so in the meantime, because we'll be doing that test, it requires self quarantine for 14 days so, if possible, that would mean distancing from your husband in the home as well for that 14 day period, but the results should come back from that test within the next several days.

It sounds like it could be some kind of infective process, like maybe some kind of viral infection that we're concerned about, particularly this year. I'd really like to get a swab done on you. It's not necessarily covid, but it potentially could be. So what we're going to have to ask you to do is to self isolate you and your family for 14 days and hopefully will get the results back shortly and you'll know whether your COVID test is positive or not."
1158,OK.,Does that sound like a good plan to you?
1159,"Yeah, that sounds good.",OK well thanks for chatting with me. We will get that swab done right away.

It's super weird I like live with my boyfriend and he was like here take a bite of this onion and I like bit into it and I literally didn't taste anything. Otherwise, like I feel totally fine. I just heard that this happens sometimes like with COVID and. I'm just kind of worried that I have COVID.","OK, for sure I will we will, um definitely look into that today and you are right, it is a symptom that can occur with with covid. But we will want to make sure that it isn't something else, and so I wanted to just ask you a few more questions about how you've been feeling. So you said you haven't felt sick, so have you been experiencing any other symptoms?"

1201,I don't think so.,"OK, anybody in the family have a heart condition or a lung condition?"
1202,No.,Alright and then I have anybody in the family had cancer before?
1203,Like my like my Uncle um had like prostate cancer.,"OK, do you know, breast cancer, ovarian cancer?"
1204,No.,"OK. So that that was all I wanted to ask about on, uh, the history today. Was there anything else that I maybe forgot to ask about?"
1205,Mmm I don't know that's it.,"OK, so, uh, yeah with, uh, the symptoms of losing your smell over the last day or so we will certainly look into. Whether or not this is caused by COVID and so that will require a nasal swab test for that. Usually the results are coming back now within 48 hours hopefully, but still will be required to self isolate now for the next 14 days after your symptoms are gone, so we will let you know when the results come back from this test though."
1206,"OK. OK, geez OK. Thank you.","Alright, you're welcome."
1207,"Yeah, so uh, like around three or four days ago I started, uh to get really nauseous and since then I've been vomiting every few hours and really I don't know. Just yesterday started to started to have some diarrhea as well.","OK, so that's three or four days ago for the nausea and vomiting, is that correct?"
1208,"Uh yeah yeah the nausea start kind of started three or four days ago and then after that that the vomiting came. So yeah maybe the vomiting was more like 2 days ago it started, and then diarrhea kind of the last day.","OK OK. OK, and before that you were feeling well?"
1209,"Yeah, well I was feeling maybe like a little tired for a day or two before, but um, I don't know. Sometimes you just feel like that, so I didn't really think much of it, but.","Sure, OK. And since it started, have, I know these all kind of started at different times but has have your symptoms gotten worse overtime?"
1210,"Yeah, they they. They've gotten worse. At first they were kinda really spread it like far enough apart that I would thought it was just going to go away on its own and then it it hasn't so has me concerned.","OK, I'm just going to ask you a few more questions about the vomiting. Have you noticed any blood in your vomit?"
1211,"No, it's been kind of yellowish.","OK, and just if you notice like a like a really bright kind of yellow green substance in your vomit."
1212,"Umm not really bright, but I mean maybe more like dark green or yeah nothing bright.",OK And you said now it's it's happening every couple hours for you?
1213,"Um yeah every few every few hours it's been ah. It seems to be what I'm like like after eating, it is just making me making me nauseous.","OK, OK, so have you been able to eat anything? When's the last time you actually had something to eat?"

1222,"Um No. I I, I haven't been in contact with anybody, anybody who's been sick.","OK. In addition to the symptoms that you're describing to me, have you had any fevers?"
1223,I've I started to feel hot this morning.,"OK, have you had any chills?"
1224,Nothing like that.,Any shakes?
1225,No.,K night sweats?
1226,Um no night sweats.,Have you had any cough?
1227,"Umm no, I haven't really had a cough by my throat's felt a little like scratchy though.","OK, scratchy throat OK. Have you had any sore throat?"
1228,"No, I wouldn't really say it's sore, but. Yeah, I mean we just kinda like like itchy.","OK. OK, have you noticed any changes to your sense of smell or taste?"
1229,"No, I haven't noticed any changes to those.","OK. Mmmm. And you live, do you live alone or with family?"

1231,They were. They've been feeling fine.,"OK. OK, um, so just in terms of your general health, are there any conditions that you see your family doctor for regularly?"
1232,"I have anxiety and back pain. So, uh, I do get ah. Some hydromorphone for for that.",OK
1233,For the back pain anyway.,"OK. Um, and what medications do you take besides the hydromorphone?"
1234,"Uh, uh, Escitalopram.",OK.
1235,And that we've been working on trying on decreasing the hydromorphone now over the last year. So it's a work in progress though.,"OK, and have you ever had any surgeries?"
1236,"Uh, yeah on my on my back I was in an accident a few years back. So, um. Well, that's where the pain is from.","OK, sad to hear that. Do you have any allergies?"
1237,"Um yeah, to penicillin. I had a hives when I was a kid.","OK Um, OK um. Let me see, uh, so in terms of your family history. Do you have any family history of your digestive system problems or respiratory problems?"
1238,"Um Yeah, no one in my families had any problems with their stomach or I haven't heard of any like colon cancer. I mean my my dad had a heart attack when he was in his late 60s, but that's kind of the only thing that I can think happened in my family in terms of health.","OK. And it sounds so. It sounds like you live at home with your family, do you? What do you do for work?"
1239,"Yeah, I I work for a tech company so I was going down to meet a potential buyer for one of our products.","OK. OK, and just in terms of your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?"
1240,Um yeah I will have wine. Maybe one or two glasses on on the weekend.,"OK, do you smoke cigarettes?"
1241,"Umm no but I I used to, I I quit about seven years ago. Yeah, so I quit about seven years ago.","Um OK. So do you use any other substances, like cannabis?"
1242,"Um I will have a joint every once in awhile if I with friends, but that's been it's been awhile. 'cause of the pandemic haven't really been hanging out with anybody.","Sure. Um OK, I think that's all the questions that I had for you today. So it sounds like there's probably some kind of infection going on. What it is exactly, it's hard to say. There are some cases of COVID-19 that, that are more like GI symptoms then than simply respiratory symptoms. So I think we should probably give you a COVID swab and then we ask that you and everyone in your house self-isolates for a few days until you've got it in a negative result and in a few days without symptoms."
1243,"OK, that sounds good.","So yeah, we'll get that started for you, and otherwise, really, we want to know if it's COVID is just for infection control purposes, but I think that essentially you should be drinking lots of fluids and getting a lot of rest. And it's something that likely should go away on its own. I mean, if things start to become a lot worse and you get really dehydrated and you have fevers that you can't control with Tylenol, then please come back to the emergency Department. But I think in general it will just be kind of supportive treatments for what you're experiencing."
1244,"OK, that sounds good. I'll get some Gatorade on the way home.","Perfect. Actually, don't go into the store. Have someone else get it for you, but."
1245,OK will do. Thank you.,Have a good have a good day. Thanks for chatting with me.
1246,"Sure, I've had this terrible headache for the past four days. Doesn't seem to be getting any better, and I feel hot like I have a fever. I've been coughing a lot so I am I'm worried I have COVID, so I'm here.",OK. So I'll start with the headaches. When did when did that exactly started?
1247,"Uh the headache started, OK so the coughing started four days ago. The headache started shortly after so I would say later on during that day and then the fever I've had for, fever I think I've had for the past two days. I haven't actually taken my temperature though.","OK um. So, uh, the cough is started four days ago. Has the cough gotten better, worse, or stayed the same?"
1248,The cough has stayed the same.,"OK, are you bringing up any phlegm or sputum with the cough?"
1249,"Um, it's not really phlegm, but sometimes I cough up, like bits of like. You know little bits that look like blood or something.","OK, so you're seeing some like red when when you're coughing up?"
1250,Mmmm,"OK, and how much of this are you seeing like, is it like a teaspoon amount or or more?"
1251,"Oh, it's it's very little. It's like maybe a little bit bigger than like the tip of a pencil.","Oh OK, are you, OK, are you seeing this on like kind of tissues afterwards sort of thing?"
1252,Yeah.,"OK, um and any triggers for the cough you can think of?"
1253,"No, it just seems to be there all day. Um, doesn't really get better with me trying to rest or not.","OK, and is the cough there at night time too?"
1254,"Yes, it is definitely there at night.","OK, um is it interfering with sleep?"
1255,"Ah yes, I haven't been sleeping well.","OK, um, and with your cough have you had any difficulties with breathing?"
1256,"Um, no.","Alright, and now, how about any wheezing?"
1257,No wheezing.,"OK. And with this headache when it first came on, did you experience a like worst headache of your life, or a Thunder clap sensation?"
1258,"No, it's it's not that bad, but it just seems to be there all day long.","OK, um have you had headaches like this before?"
1259,"No, I've never gotten headaches in the past.","OK, uh is the headache associated with any nausea or vomiting?"
1260,No.,"OK, and is the headache worse in the morning when you first wake up?"
1261,No.,"OK, and does it have to get worse if you lie flat?"
1262,No.,"OK, and has this headache been getting worse, staying the same, getting better?"
1263,It's it's about the same.,"OK. Um and, um and you haven't checked the temperature yet, you said, but you felt hot?"
1264,"Yes, that's right.","OK, any other symptoms that you've been experiencing?"
1265,Not that I can think of.,"OK, there's just a few others that I wanted to ask about to be comprehensive. Have you had any eye pain or ear pain?"
1266,No.,How about any discharge from either your eyes or ears?
1267,"No, nothing like that.","Alright, have you had any changes to either your sense of smell or your sense of taste?"

1276,None.,"Alright, in any episodes of feeling really dizzy or lightheaded."
1277,No.,"OK, and how about any fainting spells or feeling like you might faint?"
1278,"No, nothing like that.",OK. And have you had any abdominal pain?
1279,"Um no, no abdominal pain.",Any diarrhea or constipation?
1280,No.,How about any painful urination or feeling as though you need to urinate really frequently?
1281,Ah no nothing like that.,"OK, and have you had any skin changes like rashes or anything like that?"
1282,No.,"OK, and how about any muscle aches or joint aches or just overall like body pains?"
1283,"Mmm no, not that I that not. Not that I've noticed, no.","OK, is there anything in regards to your past health that you see a physician regularly for?"
1284,"Um No. Ah actually I I think at one point, um, I was worked up for something called familial hypercholesterolemia because it ran in the family. But I think those results were normal.","OK, so do you, um, do you take a statin medication then?"
1285,Yeah I take a low dose statin.,"OK, and when was your last lipid panel checked?"
1286,I think it was two years ago.,"I see, and um do you remember if the LDL was normal at that time?"
1287,Ah yes it was normal.,"OK, but since the, it was about two years ago, it might be worthwhile today just to also check a lipid panel just to be safe, but that'll be something we can talk about that more so at the end if that's OK."
1288,"Sure, yeah, that would be great.","OK, and any other medical conditions?"
1289,No.,OK. Have you had any surgeries before?
1290,C-section.,How many children do you have?

1300,Breast cancer no.,"Alright, and how about ovarian cancer?"
1301,No ovarian cancer.,"OK. And next I actually wanted to ask a few questions about your personal and lifestyle habits, but first, could you just tell me a little bit about your living situation right now?"

1303,He is 10.,"OK, um is anybody in the home been sick recently?"

1306,"We went up to we just went to um like a, we went on a hiking trail that was outside the city recently and there were a lot of people there and and we weren't wearing masks, but we, it seemed like we were keeping a good distance between each other so that that would be my only concern.",OK for sure. Were people pretty close to each other on the paths when walking by on the hike?
1307,"Ahh not like the whole time, but there would be times when you know people just kind of brushed by you to try to get ahead of you or something like that.",I see OK. And do you smoke cigarettes?
1308,No.,"Um, do you smoke marijuana?"
1309,Um no.,"OK, and do you drink alcohol?"
1310,I don't.,Do you use any other recreational drugs?
1311,Um no.,"OK, so that was all I wanted to ask about. Oh, actually one thing that I I did want to, I forgot to ask was, do you have any neck stiffness?"
1312,"No, not that I noticed.",OK. So that was the last question that I wanted to ask about. Was there anything that you wanted to tell me that I I maybe forgot?
1313,"No, I think you covered it all.  I'm just wondering do you? Do you think it's COVID or something else?","Well, it's definitely a possibility with the symptoms that you're having, since they can be so non- specific for covid it can be a lot of symptoms that overlap. So with having headache what sounds like you might have a fever and and this cough that sounds like it's pretty bad if you're bringing up some blood, it sounds like you might have irritated some of the bronchioles with the the coughing. So we will test for that and check a PCR nasal swab for COVID. I'm not, but we will also test for other viral illnesses and bacterial illnesses as well. It doesn't sound like you have meningitis right now just based on the symptoms where you don't have neck stiffness, but it'll be certainly something that we keep keep in mind while we are doing our investigations."
1314,"OK great, thank you.","Alright, you're welcome. We'll get those started."
1315,"Sure, I've been coughing for the past three days and it I can't seem to stop. It's affecting my sleep, so I just really like to get this fixed.","OK, ah is the cough, with the cough have you been bringing up any sputum?"
1316,"No, it's it's dry. It's very dry.","OK, have you brought up any blood?"
1317,No no blood.,"OK and the cough started three days ago. Has it gotten worse, gotten better, stayed the same?"
1318,"Ah you know, it seems to be getting worse, and now I even feel hot like I have a fever or something.","I see. Is there any triggers associated with the cough like going outside into the cold, smoke inhalation or or dust or pets?"
1319,"Um, no, not that I noticed.","OK, have you tried anything to you help with the cough?"
1320,"I tried over the counter cough syrup, but it's it's not helping.","OK, and you mentioned the coughs interrupting your sleep. Has is the cough constant all day or are there particular times of the day that it's worse?"
1321,It's just all day.,"Let's see OK, Um, and you mentioned that you started to feel hot when when did you notice that?"
1322,That was just today.,"Just today, have you taken your temperature?"
1323,"No, I haven't.","OK, and have you been experiencing any other symptoms?"
1324,Mmm. I've been really tired but I don't know if that's because I can't get any seem to get any sleep.,"Well, because the coughs been keeping you up OK. Um, so have you had any headaches?"
1325,"Maybe a slight headache, but also I'm not too sure if that's because I've been coughing and it's putting strain on my head.","OK, how about any discharge like mucus or tears from your eyes or ears?"
1326,"No, nothing like that.","OK, how about any pain around your eyes or ears?"

1948,"Yeah, I think I'm down like 15 pounds since the summer time, which is great.","OK, have you tried to lose weight at all or is it just been completely unintentional?"
1949,"Uh, well I, I mean my, my appendix was taken out a few months ago and so I guess after that I, well, maybe wasn't eating and eating as much, but I mean I wasn't really trying to lose weight.","OK, and have you had any recent exposure to any fumes or dust or animals?"
1950,"Uh, no, my my parents have a dog at home, but I've been away at school, so.","OK. OK, uh, in terms of your overall health, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?"

1963,"Uh, yeah I'll smoke one or two joints on on the weekend with friends socially.","OK yeah, so yeah. This uh, the smoking marijuana or cigarettes make your symptoms worse at all?"
1964,"Uhm, it depends. Yeah, sometimes I can. It can bring on some more coughing.","Yeah, so yeah, we always recommend cutting down or quitting smoking whenever, whenever we see patients who are smoking, especially like, you're fairly young. And you know your grandfather had history of lung cancer with smoking throughout the year. So as early as we can quit smoking, the better for the long term health of your lungs, but whenever you're thinking of quitting, or if you want any more resources about quitting, just let me know. We can set up a separate appointment for that."
1965,"OK, that that sounds good. Yeah, maybe maybe next appointment we can talk about that.","OK, sounds good. Um. Any, uh, so no recreational, so just besides marijuana. Any other recreational drugs like cocaine or crystal meth, anything of that sort?"
1966,"Ah, no. Well, sometimes I at parties maybe a few times a year with friends will use ecstasy or something like that, but that's only a few times a year.","OK. Uh, and any alcohol?"
1967,"Yeah, I'll have a few drinks on the weekend with with friends usually. Like rum or beer.","OK. Yeah, so this is all the questions I had for you today. Any, any questions or concerns or any ideas of what you think this might be?"
1968,"Uhm, I don't know. I'm really concerned about the the blood that I brought up like I mean is this cancer or, uh, uh tuberculosis like one of those tuberculosis infections that I heard about while I was away?","Yeah, so definitely, a cancer is pretty unlikely because you're fairly young and you've just recently started smoking, but one of the things that we're concerned about is your recent travel history being in close quarters. So definitely we need to get a chest X-Ray and we can even do a sputum culture to test for tuberculosis. And then based on the results, we might have to start you on like a whole antibiotic regiment if it does come back as tuberculosis. Yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll get those investigations done first and then we'll go from there."
1969,"OK, thank you.","We'll also get some blood work done as well, so that'll be done before your next appointment."
1970,"Alright, that sounds good. Thank you.",You're welcome.
1971,"So, just for the past, like 3 days I've been coughing. It's I I don't feel particularly sick. I'm just kind of dry like annoying call that won't go away and then today I took my temp in it It's pretty high. It was like 99 point like 9. I didn't really take it the other days, so I guess so I just thought I'd better come get it checked out because I, I am on like a biologic medication, so, for my Crohn's disease.","OK, yeah. Yeah, thank you for coming in. I think it's good that you are getting this checked out as early as possible. So just to rewind a little bit. When did your dry cough start?"
1972,"Uh, like 3 days ago three days ago.","3 days ago, OK. And when did your fever start?"
1973,"So I didn't take my temp, but like the other days, but like for sure this morning.","OK um, OK, so the cough is it always a dry cough or do you sometimes bring up sputum or blood?"

1992,No.,"OK, and are you otherwise healthy? I know you mentioned you have Crohn's disease. Do you have any other longstanding medical conditions?"
1993,"Oh, not really. Just that, and, uh, eczema.","Eczema, OK."
1994,"Tends to get pretty bad, like I don't really have any right now, but I really stay on top of it with like my moisturizers and like I always have like a hydrocortisone cream on hand just in case.","Yeah, for sure. How long have you had eczema for?"
1995,"Oh, like when I was, started when I was like a kid and then I feel like when I was a teenager I didn't really, and then part of it as an adult I really have to take care of it or else it gets bad.","OK OK. Um, have you ever been hospitalized or have you had any surgeries in the past?"
1996,"Uh, like when I was first diagnosed with Crohn's maybe 20 years ago, when I was like 20, I was in the hospital for a little bit 'cause I was really dehydrated and I couldn't really like, I just couldn't I wasn't feeling well at that time, but since then I've been pretty on top of it.","OK, that's good to hear. You mentioned you're on biologics for Crohn's disease? Are there any other medications that you're on?"
1997,"Um, just like the hydrocortisone, cream on occasion.","Right. OK. Um, OK and. Do you have any allergies?"
1998,"Ah, like I have some seasonal allergies, like ah, its ragweed, which is not like right now, is not the time for it. And like cats and dogs.",OK. OK.
1999,"It's just like this environmental, it's not like not like the really dangerous allergies, you know?","Right, OK. Um, how about immunizations? Are you up to date?"
2000,I think so.,"Alright, and in terms of family history, are there any lung conditions or heart conditions?"
2001,"Oh, like my dad had high blood pressure, but other than that I don't think there is anything that stood out.",OK. And how about your smoking history? Do you smoke at all?
2002,"Um, like I did for a couple years when I was like 18 and then I haven't ever since.","OK, how about marijuana?"

2007,"No, it's like a pretty new build.","OK, and have you been around any sick contacts recently?"
2008,"Ah I mean, my kids just left this weekend. Uhm, there's really only people I've been around. I can, I maybe I should have asked him before coming here if they like knew they had seen anyone but they were fine, over the weekend.","OK. Um, and have you traveled to anywhere recently?"
2009,No.,"No, OK. Those were all the questions that I had today were there was there anything else that you wanted to add? Anything that I missed perhaps?"
2010,I don't think so. I think that's it.,OK.
2011,"You know, I hope I hope I just wanted to come in in case it was something bad because I you know I have those other health problems. I just want to make sure. Yeah.","Yeah, yeah for sure and I think it's a good thing that you came in, so thank you. Right now, I guess top on the list of things that you could possibly have is COVID, so we'll get you tested for that and we'll get you a swab and you should have the results of the that swab in about 24 to 48 hours and then you should isolate for 14 days regardless though because your symptoms do overlap with symptoms of COVID. And, and that includes isolating from your your children as well."
2012,Oh ok.,"And yeah, and if it's not COVID, it could be another viral illness that's going around at this time of year, just so just make sure you're staying hydrated, you're eating nutritious foods and getting good sleep. If your symptoms do become worse, and if they become uhm, severe like you have a really high temperature, you have trouble breathing or you have any neurological symptoms like seizures or fainting spells, please do go to the ER and seek help. How does that sound?"
2013,"Ah yeah, I guess that sounds good. This is how it's gotta be, right?","Yeah, unfortunately, or yeah. Well, thank you again."
2014,"No, thank you. Have a good day.",You too.
2015,"Essentially, when he, so today is Friday, when he got home from school on Wednesday, he seemed fine, but he, I don't know that night he started to have a bit of like a cough. It just seemed like a little dry cough, but obviously I just wanted to keep him home, keep him safe and not like spread anything if he was sick, so he stayed at home on Thursday and he was like having a bit of a cough. Um and then, yesterday it seemed to get a little bit worse and he was really tired, or sorry it's today, today is Friday, um, he was like his cough is like getting a bit worse and I've been taking his temp the whole time and it got like a little high today. What was it? My thermometer says it was high. I'm just like trying to remember. It was it was, it was like over 100 though.",Oh OK.
2016,"101 or something or maybe 100.1. But anyways, it was, so I I just thought I should probably bring him in 'cause I was really worried about him and you know thought he could have maybe got COVID and get school or something.","Yeah for sure. Um, OK, so just to clarify, he's had this cough and fever for the past five 5 days."
2017,Mhmm.,"OK. OK, so let's focus on the cough."
2018,"Sorry, it's been more like 3 three days like Wednesday is when he came home and then, and then today's Friday, so yeah, sorry.","Today is Friday, OK. Um, OK, yeah sure. So, is this cough a productive cough, or is it kind of a dry cough?"
2019,"Ah I think it's dry. I haven't noticed him like spitting up anything. Umm, yeah, he yeah, it's just been like little coughs.","OK, and he, is he, he's not bringing up any sputum or blood?"
2020,No.,"No OK good. OK, and does he sound wheezy at all to you?"
2021,"No, no, not that I've noticed.","OK, how about short of breath?"
2022,"Um, I don't think so like he, usually he's a really active kid and he has, he hasn't been running a lot outside in the past couple days, so maybe he maybe he could have been having a harder time breathing but also I think he's just been tired in general.","OK, yeah. OK, and is his coughing getting worse with certain times of the day? Like is it worse at night in the morning?"
2023,I think it kinda just there the whole day.,"OK um. And does it, how does it sound? Does this sound like a barky cough? Does it sound? Um, like harsh, what is, what would you say the quality of it, of the sound of the cough is?"
2024,"Uh, I just sounds kind of dry. It's not like super loud.","OK. OK, and has he ever experienced anything like this in the past?"
2025,"I don't like he's had colds before, but I haven't like, I haven't like you, this time he kind of had the fever, which is different than you know, having a regular cold.",OK. And are his symptoms getting worse?
2026,"I think so. Because yeah, he first day he just seemed like little dry and then yesterday is coughing and today he actually has a fever.","OK, and um, is he complaining of anything like chest pain? Or feeling like his heart's racing?"
2027,"No, I don't think so.",No OK. Does he have a sore throat?
2028,I don't think so.,"OK, and is he having any issues swallowing food or fluids?"
2029,"I don't know if he's having trouble swallowing, but he doesn't seem to have a big appetite right now.","OK, um, and is he, does he have a blocked nose or runny nose?"
2030,Maybe a bit of like a runny nose.,"OK, and does he have any issues with smell or taste?"
2031,"Ah, this morning he really seemed like he wasn't like into his breakfast and I wonder if he's losing his sense of taste a little bit.","OK, how about vision or hearing?"
2032,I think those are fine.,"OK, and is he complaining of any chills or night sweats?"
2033,No.,"OK, any changes in his hair, nails or skin like rashes?"
2034,"No, I haven't noticed anything like that.","OK, any changes in his bowel movements?"
2035,"Uh, no.",Pardon?
2036,"I'm sorry, no changes.","OK, no diarrhea, no constipation, no blood in the stool."
2037,No.,"OK, any nausea or vomiting?"
2038,No.,"OK, any changes in his urine?"
2039,"Really been looking, but I don't think so.",Any dizziness or fainting spells?
2040,"No, just like fatigue.","OK, any confusion or memory loss?"
2041,No.,"And is he an, is he an otherwise healthy child?"
2042,"Yeah, absolutely, he hasn't like decide to like vaccines, he hasn't had to go to the doctor like ever. I mean, he broke his arm once but that was it.","OK, so no past illnesses and I guess no hospitalizations or surgeries except for the broken arm?"
2043,"Exactly, like nothing.",OK and were things normal with your pregnancy with him?
2044,Yeah totally,"OK. Ah, and then how about as a newborn, any complications after birth?"
2045,"No, no, like everything was things really good.",OK and then did he hit all his milestones? Up till now?
2046,Yeah totally,OK. And does he have any allergies?
2047,"Uhm, no, no, I don't think so. I mean like he hasn't really taken a lot of medicine, so it's hard to say, but like nothing, so far.",Is he up to date with all his immunizations?
2048,Yep.,"Yeah, OK. And in terms of family history, are there any lung conditions or heart conditions?"
2049,"Uh, no, everyone is really healthy.","OK, and um, are there, and who does he live with and where does he live?"
2050,"He lives with me and my husband, and he has a little sister like just in town here.","OK, and is she healthy?"
2051,"Yeah I like she, yeah she's healthy.","OK an any concerns for old carpets, mold, asbestos or any environmental issues like that in the home that you're in?"
2052,No.,"No OK, um has he been around any sick contacts recently?"
2053,"Not not like outside of school. I like we know for sure, not outside of school but he goes to school right now so kind of hard to say. They haven't like contacted us about anything.","OK, sure. And has he traveled anywhere recently?"
2054,No.,"No, OK. OK, well those are all the questions I had for you today. Were, was there anything that I missed that you wanted to chat about today?"
2055,"I don't think so. Like I realized that I can often times like we don't really do much for kids when you know, when it's just like a virus or something. But we do, I guess, need to have a COVID test to go back to school, even if you know either way 'cause they want us to be able to say it's like the other kids have had uh an exposure.",Mhmm.
2056,"So yeah yeah, like. Sorry, go ahead.",No go ahead.
2057,"So I just wanted to basically see if it was that and I mean he does receive you're so scared. That's kind of what made me come in, like it's scaring me a little bit.","Right, yeah, OK, so first thing is, first we need to do a COVID swab just to make sure that he either has it or it doesn't have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Umm we do suggest because his symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister if possible. And then if the swap comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays. If his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms like seizures or if he's feeling weak, dizzy, if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and uhm, so for now I'll just wait for those COVID swabs to come back. How does that sound?"
2058,"Yeah, sounds good.",OK great.
2059,Thank you.,"Yeah, no worries. Uhm and I should have mentioned if it was just the cough or if he was just short of breath or something like that and he didn't have the fever, we would add everything's like asthma to the list of things"
2060,"OK yeah, that's good to know.","Alright, sounds great. Have a good day."
2061,"Um I just uh I have, I have a cough that I've had for a couple of days and like normally if I had a cough or cold, I would just like stay home and rest, but just because you know there's like Covid I I wanted to make sure, like I wanted to get checked out.","Yeah, of course that that was a great idea. Thanks for coming in. Um how long have you had this cough for?"
2062,"Uh it's like 2 days. Like maybe three days ago, I started to feel like my throat was dry and I was like, oh, maybe I need to drink more water or something and then the next day I started like actually coughing.","OK, is it a dry cough or a wet cough?"
2063,Yeah it's really dry.,"Really dry, OK. So no sputum, no blood that you're bringing up?"
2064,"No, nothing like that. It's just kind of annoying.","Yeah, um do you have any wheeziness associated with your coughing?"
2065,I don't think so.,"No, OK. No shortness of breath?"
2066,"No, no, I've been, I feel like I've been tired, but I don't think it's been actually hard to breathe. I just feel overall like really tired.","OK, OK, and have you tried anything for the cough, like um over the counter cough syrup or anything like that?"
2067,"Uh like I have, I've just been drinking tea and just like tea with honey just to like make it feel better. I I didn't like take any medicine.","OK, and do you, have you noticed that there are any triggers for your cough, like the cold, or dust, or any like environmental triggers?"
2068,"I mean, I've been, just because of Covid and stuff, I've been staying home ever since I had it.","OK, and do you find that it's constantly there or um is it worse during a particular time of day, like morning, afternoon, or evening?"
2069,It's kind of just been there,"OK, and um is it getting worse, do you think?"
2070,"I think so. I think like today is worse than yesterday, and the day before that, it just felt like dry and then and then like the next day I started coughing, so yeah.","OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?"
2071,"I mean, I've had coughs before, um this one feels like particularly dry, but uh like it, it's not too different than like when I'm just like, like had a cough in other years.","OK, OK. Um and you mentioned that your throat was also dry. Do you have a sore throat?"
2072,"Maybe a little bit this morning, yeah, like at first it just felt dry like I was thinking like, oh it's like you know I need to take a sip of water or something and now it just feels, now it's starting to think, I feel a little bit sore, I think.","OK, um is it hard for you to swallow foods or fluids?"
2073,"Oh sorry, could you repeat that? I just missed the last part.",Oh no worries. Is it hard for you to swallow food or fluids?
2074,"Uh no, it's not hard. It's not hard to swallow things.","OK um, and then have you had a runny nose or a stuffy nose?"
2075,"No, not particularly.","No, OK. How about any changes to your hearing or vision?"
2076,No.,"No, how about changes in smell or taste?"
2077,"Uh, no, that's like a Covid thing, right? Like I was hoping because I could still, I could still like taste my coffee this morning, I was hoping that that means I don't have Covid, but yeah, I don't really know.","I mean yeah, some people have it, some people don't. Um I guess people with Covid present in different ways, yeah yeah, do you have a fever at all?"
2078,"Um like when I came in here, when the nurse took my temperature, she said I had um, like she said I had a fever. Uh I don't have a thermometer at home, um but like I've been feeling really hot so would probably, I've probably been having it for a couple of days.","OK, OK, we can take, yeah we can take your temperature. Sorry, did you say you already took your temperature today and?"
2079,"The nurse took it, yeah, I don't know what it was, but the nurse kept coming in and she said it was a",OK OK yeah so yeah we'll double check to make sure that um you either do or don't have a fever. Um have you experienced any chills or night sweats over the past few days?
2080,"Uh, no.","No, OK. OK, how about um any weight loss?"
2081,"No, like I don't weigh myself regularly, but I don't think so.","OK, um any changes to your hair or uh nails or skin, like rashes?"
2082,Uh no.,"No, OK. How about um chest pain?"
2083,"Uh, no.","No chest pain, OK. Um swelling in your limbs?"

2096,"Yeah, like I, I've been seeing my family doctor and they they said they thought it might be, um but we don't really know, just like in general, I guess they've been calling it IBS.","Oh, I see, OK. Um, OK."

2115,"Uh no, it's like a new a new building.","OK, OK, and do you think you may have been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?"
2116,"Well, so um, I work uh in like, I work in an office that's attached to a factory um and I, so like I have to actually be there, I haven't been able to work from home. Um and there was someone else in my office that I think was coughing in that, like last week and I I don't know, I questioned it but I I didn't actually get to talk to them and ask them, or like I don't know if they were actually sick or something. So, I might have been, and we wear masks and everything, like we're really good, but I don't know, I feel like the offices aren't like super, like the air flow's not that great.",Yeah.
2117,"So yeah, I think that's another reason I was concerned, that I I feel like some people might have been sick and I didn't really know the whole story.","Right, OK, so potentially, from from the workplace then, OK."
2118,Yeah.,"And, OK, um have you traveled anywhere recently?"
2119,No.,"No, OK. Well those were all the questions that I had for you today, was there um anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss today?"
2120,Uh not that I can think of.,"No, OK. So right now it seems like, if I'm going through my differential diagnosis list for you, at the top is, the thing that we have to rule out is Covid, so we'll take a swab and send it off for those PCR results and you'll hear back either tomorrow or the day after, about the results. But in the mean time, and I guess even if the test is negative, um and you're still having symptoms, please do isolate for 14 days. Um and if your symptoms get worse, um like you know, you're having trouble breathing, uh your fever, your temperature is off the charts, um or you're having any sort of neurological symptom, please do um go to the ER and seek out help. Um if it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around at, during this time of year, um, and usually the treatment for that kind of stuff is supportive, so make sure you're staying well hydrated, you're eating nutritious foods, uh you're getting good sleep. Um and if not, and your symptoms, you know you're having a productive cough, um you're really short of breath, uh we can test you to see if you have some sort of bacterial pneumonia, and those are usually treated with antibiotics, so that's kind of the plan right now. Um so we'll just start with that Covid swab for now. How does that sound?"
2121,"Yeah, that that sounds great. That's really what it, like, I I don't feel super sick, I just really wanna know if I have Covid or not.","Yeah for sure and I, and I think it's good that you came in."
2122,Awesome.,"Alright, thank you."
2123,"I've had a cough that started like 4 days ago, um and it's just been getting worse, so I I wanted to come in.","OK yeah, it's good that you've come in. Um, so the cough started four days ago, has it been constant since?"
2124,Yes it has.,"OK, and how often are you coughing?"
2125,"I um, I'd say a few times an hour now. Uh when it first started, it was a bit more intermittent, but now it's happening um all day long and throughout the night as well, it interrupted my sleep last night.","Oh OK, um is it a dry cough or are you producing sputum?"
2126,It's it's mostly dry.,"OK, so no sputum, no blood?"
2127,No blood.,"OK. Um do you find that there are any triggers to your, to this cough, like um, environmental triggers, like the cold weather, um any old carpets at home, or um you know a particular time of the day, or exertion, anything like that?"
2128,"No, interestingly, nothing like that seems to really make it worse. It's just been um kinda coughing all day.","OK, and um has anything made it better? Have you tried anything for this cough?"
2129,Uh I tried um drinking some uh like tea and some other cough syrups and it didn't didn't help.,"OK, um how about, ah, OK. And if you were to describe the quality of this cough, would you say it's it's, it sounds barky, it sounds harsh, um how would you describe it?"

2137,"Yeah, yeah exertion. Um as well as like the cough itself, I'm finding that I'm coughing so much throughout the day that I'm having a hard time catching up and catching my breath afterwards.","Yeah, for sure. Um OK, and any chest pain?"

2147,"The, really, these last like 2 days.","OK, and any changes in your taste?"
2148,"Uh I haven't really I, I thought, well, I wasn't really able to taste my food, but I thought that was because I couldn't, I wasn't smelling, um so I thought that was just going to go away, but the symptoms have gotten worse.","Yeah, and have you had a fever or chills in the past few days?"
2149,"Uh yeah, I've had a fever um or I felt hot anyway.",Did you take your temperature?
2150,"I haven't checked it, but um like I've been feeling pretty sweaty from how hot I've been.",OK um so we'll take your temperature today and we'll let you know. Um have you noticed any weight loss over the past few weeks?

2174,"Um no, that, I was just worried about uh Covid.","Yeah, so that's definitely top on the list right now for things that we have to rule you out for. Um so we'll take a swab today, we'll send it off um for those PCR results, you should hear back in 24 to 48 hours. Uh in the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days, and that includes from family members when possible, and public health will get in touch with you if those results are positive and so they can they can do some contact tracing. If it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around, and I guess the best therapy for that is staying hydrated, um getting good sleep, and eating nutritious foods. Uh but if your symptoms get worse, like you're running a really high fever, um you're having neurological symptoms like you know seizures or fainting spells, um or if you're having difficulty breathing, um you should come back to the ER.

2180,"Um yeah, smoking definitely makes it worse. I I haven't smoked the last few days 'cause each time I lit a cigarette it it brought it on.","OK, well that's good that you're taking a little break from smoking. Um how would you describe the quality of your cough, is it, does it sound harsh?"
2181,"Yeah, the cough's like, yeah, harsh.","Harsh, OK. And in terms of severity, 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is it?"

2210,"Uh no, I haven't noticed anything like that.",OK.
2211,"But I haven't been able to smell so, who knows?","Right, OK, true. Um in terms of your abdominal pain, when did that start?"
2212,"Uh I I think around the same time as the diarrhea, so the last two days.","OK, um any nausea or vomiting?"
2213,"Um no vomiting, but I've I felt nauseous.","OK. The abdominal pain, is it, where is it located? Is it pretty central? Is it general?"

You've had uh for the past four days more or less, you've had um a possible fever, um this cough, um loss of smell and taste, um diarrhea, uh abdominal pain, and nausea. Is that correct?"

2301,No.,"No, OK. OK, well I think those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or concerns or anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss?"

2303,That sounds great. Thank you.,Alright. Take care.
2304,"Yeah, so I just came in because I've been having this cough that's getting worse over the last uh one and a half week and uh, I've also just recently in the last few days been getting some shortness of breath. Um and I also noticed uh my bowel movements have changed a little bit as well over the last week.","OK, so yeah, let's break this down. The cough, when did that start?"
2305,"The cough, I think it started uh probably like around 10 days ago.","10 days ago, OK, and how about the shortness of breath?"
2306,That just started in the last uh I think 3 days.,"OK, and then the the bowel bowel changes, when did that start?"
2307,"Yes, I think it also started in like, I would say, for the last three days I've been getting uh diarrhea.","OK OK, so let's go back to the cough, is it constant or um is it triggered by certain things like the cold air, dust, um you know, um, certain times of the day, like morning, evening?"
2308,"Um, I would say it's pretty pretty constant since the last like 10 days, uh it's, there's no real pattern to it, and I've mostly just been inside my house. I don't think there are any triggers or I don't own any pets or anything like that, no new rugs, like uh, no no new changes really in my house.","OK, OK and um have you tried anything to make it better?"
2309,"Um, no, not really. I I've done some uh home remedies like trying to do one of those steam steam masks and see if that helps, but it didn't really do anything.","OK. Um and how about um the quality of that cough? Is it, does it sound harsh?"
2310,"Um, yeah I would say it's getting a little bit harsh. It's more just like, I'm not bringing anything up, it's more like a dry cough um, but yeah, I would say it's getting worse, definitely.","OK. Um, is it a dry cough then, or are you producing a little bit of sputum or blood or anything like that?"
2311,"No, no, I haven't seen any blood at all and rarely do I bring like up some sputum, but like most of the time it's just a dry cough.","OK, it's a dry cough. Um and would you say the cough's getting worse?"
2312,"Yeah, I'd definitely say in the last um three to four days I've been just coughing nonstop, it's very irritating.","Yeah, have you experienced anything like this before?"
2313,"Um, probably a few years ago, I think I caught the flu or something and got really sick with a fever and just a lot of coughing. But since then, nothing else.","OK. Um the shortness of breath, 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is it?"
2314,"Uh probably like a five. It kind of just started out with uh, three days ago, was kind of like I just","Yeah, um does anything make the shortness of breath worse? Like I guess um you know exertion, uh laying down, anything like that?"
2315,"Um, not really. Maybe like sitting down helps sometimes, but even when I'm sitting down I'm still coughing.",OK. OK and um do you have any wheeziness?
2316,"No, I don't think so.","OK, any chest pain?"
2317,"Um, maybe from all the coughing, sometimes I feel like there's some pain there, but it's not not anything that's too painful.","OK, um do you feel like your heart's racing at all?"
2318,"Uh no, not really.",OK. Um have you noticed any swelling in your limbs?

2328,"No, no sore throat.",OK. Um any issues swallowing food?

2332,"No, diarrhea.","Diarrhea, right. Um how often are you having a bowel movement right now?"

2334,"Like a little bit, but it's mostly liquidy.",OK. Any solids at all? Like is it semi solid at all?
2335,"Um maybe a little bit, but mostly it's just liquid.","OK, um any blood in the stool?"

2340,"Uh, so I do have diabetes and high blood pressure.","OK, do you take any medications for those conditions?"
2341,"Yeah, so for diabetes I'm taking this medication called uh like I think metformin and then for the blood pressure, uh I think it's, I forgot the name, I think it's something like um ramipril or something like that.","Yep, OK, and you're taking that um as directed, right?"
2342,"Yeah, I've been taking that regularly and my blood pressure, I've been measuring, it's been pretty steady, no changes.","OK, that's good. Have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?"
2343,"I did have my appendix removed, probably in my 20s, but uh that was the only thing.","OK, um and do you have any allergies?"

2355,"No, she's been completely fine, and I've been kind of isolating myself from her over the last week.","OK, well that's good and that's smart, um just because you don't know what you have, right?"
2356,Mhmm.,"Yeah OK, do, can you think of any other sick contacts that you may have had over the past one or two weeks or even three weeks?"
2357,"Um I go to the grocery store, then I go to work, I haven't noticed anyone being sick at work, but you know, you never know like who comes in asymptomatic and like they might be carrying it, with this","Yeah, for sure. Um yeah, for sure, have you traveled to anywhere recently?"
2358,"No, uh we've been in Canada, Ontario, haven't left to go anywhere.","OK. OK, well those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or did you have any concerns, anything that you wanted to discuss today?"
2359,"Yeah no, I just uh was wondering if I can get the covid test, that would just, I wanted to make sure I don't give anyone covid if I do have it.","Yeah, for sure, I think that's a good idea. Um so, and it's definitely something that we need to rule out, so we'll do a covid swab today um and you'll hear back within 24 to 48 hours, um but in the mean time, regardless of whether you actually have covid or not, because your symptoms overlap with covid, um it's good to isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from your wife as well if possible, and public health should be in touch if it's positive uh to do contact tracing. Um and if it's not covid, it's probably another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. Uh if your symptoms get worse, um you know you're having neurological symptoms or or if your fever gets really high, or you're having a lot of trouble breathing, then you should go see the ER. How does that sound?"
2360,"My, if my breathing gets worse uh I'll just go to the emergency Department?","Yes, please do."
2361,"OK, sounds good.","Alright, take care."
2362,"Yeah, nice to meet you I, I've been having just over the last week my cough that's been getting worse and I had a fever a couple of nights and just yesterday I noticed that I started having a loss of taste and smell so that got me really worried.","OK, so yeah, let's rewind a little bit. The cough you said started a couple of weeks ago, so would that be about 2 weeks? Three weeks?"
2363,"I would say last week, so like 7 seven days ago.","Seven days ago, OK. So that started seven days ago and then when did the fever start?"
2364,"The fever I hasn't been constant, but I've like had some nights where I just feel really chilly and then during the day sometimes even getting these chills I've been recorded at a temperature, but I think I've had a fever at least three times in the last week.","OK, so you haven't actually taken your temperature, but it you just feel like you have chills?"
2365,Yeah.,"OK, we could take your temperature today. And then the loss of smell and taste. Do they both happen at the same time?"
2366,"I think the taste happened like before, but that was just yesterday and then yesterday morning like at breakfast, I couldn't really taste anything and then continued during lunch and dinner, but smell, I kind of lost around the evening.",OK.
2367,"Yeah, all just started yesterday.","OK. Um alright, so let's go back to the cough and has it been constant since it started?"
2368,"Yeah, it's been pretty constant. It's been getting worse, especially like in the last few days. I'm mainly coughing like before I was coughing mainly at night, but now I'm coughing throughout the day.","OK, um so yeah, you mentioned possibly a trigger would be like time of day at night? Or did you notice any other triggers like you know, the cold air or dust or anything at home that could be potentially triggering your cough?"
2369,"Uh no, not really. Like I've lived in the same place for awhile, no new changes and I've been barely going outside, so I don't think there are any triggers.","OK, and in terms of the quality of your cough is that, would you say it's harsh? Barky?"
2370,"Uhm, I would just say it's like kind of harsh at times, but mainly it's a dry cough, like I'm not bringing anything up.","OK, OK. And then you said dry cough so no sputum or blood right?"
2371,No.,OK. Have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?
2372,"Not the loss of taste and smell, but like the other stuff when I just had a cold or flu like symptoms previously, but the taste and smell is something completely new.","OK. And then, um, have you experienced any shortness of breath?"
2373,"Um, not really, no.","No, OK. How about we wheeziness?"
2374,No.,Chest pain?
2375,No chest pain.,"OK. Uh, experienced any weight loss recently?"
2376,"No, not that I know.","OK, how about fatigue?"
2377,"I have been a bit tired in the last few days. The fevers at night and morning. Just feeling a little bit crummy, just not really energetic, energetic to do anything.","Yeah, for sure."
2378,"Just been planner, just sitting on the couch.","OK. Any changes to your hair, nails, or skin, like rashes?"
2379,"No, I haven't noticed anything like that.","OK, you mentioned loss of smell. Do you have a runny nose or a stuffy nose?"
2380,"I did have a runny nose earlier this week, but that's kind of subsided. Other than that, I don't really feel too much congestion. I've been taking Tylenol, the Tylenol cold so I don't know if that helped.","OK, how often are you taking the Tylenol cold?"
2381,I just took it like for four days just before going to sleep in the last week.,"Oh, I see. OK. OK and then. Any I do have a sore throat?"
2382,No.,"No, ok. How about any changes to your vision or hearing?"
2383,"No, nothing like that.",Any pain or discharge in the eyes or ears?
2384,No.,OK. Do you ever feel like your heart's racing?
2385,"Uh no, not really.","No, OK. And any swelling in your limbs?"
2386,"Uh, no, I don't think so.","OK, any dizziness or fainting spells?"
2387,No.,OK. Confusion or memory loss?
2388,"No, not that I can tell.","OK, any changes in your bowel habits like constant constipation or diarrhea."
2389,"Oh no, not really.","No, no blood in the stool, right?"
2390,No.,"OK, any changes to your appetite?"
2391,"Um, just maybe in like a little bit with the loss of smell and taste, the food is not really the same in the last day, last few days?","Yeah yeah, that makes sense. Any nausea or vomiting?"
2392,No.,"No, OK. And any changes in terms of urine?"
2393,"No, I've been peeing alright.","OK, good. Any major or a longstanding medical conditions, or are you otherwise healthy?"
2394,"No, I've been fortunate otherwise healthy. I had asthma as a kid, but like I haven't had to use the puffers for more than a decade.",Oh ok. OK. And what triggers your asthma?
2395,I think back then it was just when I did sports and I was running around a lot. I've been fine for the last 10 years at least.,"OK. OK, that's good. And any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?"
2396,No.,"No, OK. Any are you on any medications?"
2397,"Currently just the other thing, Tylenol cold, but other than that no other medications.","OK, not even other over the counter medications or herbal supplements?"
2398,"No, nothing like that.",OK. Do you have any allergies?
2399,"Um, sometimes in the fall like I get a bit sniffly and, but other than that, I don't know of any allergies to any foods or medications.",OK. And how about immunizations? Are you up to date?
2400,"Yeah, they're all up to date.",Any lung conditions or heart conditions that run in the family?
2401,"Uh, my father did recently have a heart attack at age of 58 I think he was, he, he's fine though, but that's that's about it.","OK, um any cancers that run in the family?"
2402,"Um, no, I don't think so.","OK. And, and do you smoke?"
2403,"Uh, yeah, yeah I do.","OK, how much do you smoke?"
2404,"Probably, I would say a pack a day.","Pack a day, OK. For how long?"
2405,"Ah, probably since in my 20s, so at least 10 years now.","OK, have you ever thought about cutting down?"
2406,"Yeah, especially with this pandemic going on, it's been, I've been trying to cut down just because like I don't want to get the, get COVID and then you know my lungs are probably already weaker because of the smoking. So I've been trying to cut down.","Yeah, for sure it's good that you're trying to cut down. We have resources to help you if you ever need them."
2407,"Yeah, for sure.",Do you do marijuana?
2408,"No, no, I've never tried marijuana.","OK, how about other recreational drugs?"
2409,"No, um, besides alcohol, nothing else.","OK, and then um, I guess I'll ask you about the alcohol, uhm, how much do you drink?"
2410,"Um, um, not that much. I'd probably say like a few times a week when there's a game on. I just grab a couple of beers, but that's about it.","OK. Uhm, and where do you live right now?"
2411,"Yes, I just live just outside of London with my wife and daughter in a small townhouse.",OK and anyone else at home sick?
2412,"No. I I've kind of stayed away once I noticed some symptoms. I'm just kind of just staying in my room, not getting out. I don't wanna make any of my families like.","Yeah, that makes sense. And have you traveled to anywhere recently?"
2413,"No, umm, I haven't really traveled. I do I do go to work though I haven't in the last last week. I've told them that I've been having these symptoms, but other than that, no traveling.","OK. Uhm, OK, that's good. Those were all the questions I had for you today. Was there anything that you wanted to ask me or anything else that you wanted to discuss that I may have missed?"
2414,"Uh, yeah, I I that I'm just wondering like I could it be COVID I I don't know. I don't know if someone in the office had it or yeah, it was just basically worried about, if I had COVID.","Yeah for sure. that's definitely something that we need to rule out, so we will be doing a COVID swab on you and and you will hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with the results. But regardless, because your symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID especially umm, the loss of smell and taste, we do recommend that you isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from family members as well. So we'll, that's where we'll start. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. But, we'll start with, we'll start with these COVID swabs. How does that sound?"
2415,"Yeah, that sounds good. I'll, I'll let my work know and yeah, hopefully it comes back negative, but I'll stay away from everyone till then.","OK, sounds great, thank you."
2416,"Sure, um, I have been coughing a lot. I've been feeling short of breath and I just feel really wheezy, so I thought I should come check it out.","OK, when did the cough start?"
2417,"I've always had a cough. Well, I guess I've had a cough for the past five years, but over the past three days it's gotten a lot worse.","OK, did anything happen 3 days ago that has brought the cough on?"
2418,"Uhm, no, I was, I did groceries, I came home and then I started coughing a little bit more and I haven't been able to stop since.","OK, is there any particular time of day that the cough is worse, like morning, night?"

2420,"I am. Umm, and it looks yellow and sometimes even green.",OK. With your cough prior to three days ago were you bringing up sputum with that?

2424,"Uhm, I also, I guess I notice that mostly last night, yeah.","OK, um and what types of activities have you had shortness of breath?"

2455,No.,OK. Are your immunizations up to date?
2456,"I believe so, but I recently learned that I should get something called the pneumococcal vaccine. I haven't gotten that yet.","Yeah, you're you're right. So for um, in Canada or anybody or in Ontario, at least, anybody who's older than 65, it's recommended to get this vaccine to protect against certain types of bacterial infections type which can cause pneumonia. So it would be good something that you can set up with your family doctor."
2457,OK.,"Yeah, and so are you, so do you smoke cigarettes?"
2458,I used to.,"OK, and how much do you smoke or how much did you use to smoke?"

2466,"Um, no, just um, what do you think the problem is? I've never felt this bad with my shortness of breath before.","Yeah, certainly so umm, it, it sounds like it could be maybe a viral infection that I brought on this cough and worsen the sputum. This could be a bacterial infection, it could be a COPD exacerbation and also one of the other things that we would have to consider right now is Covid as well and so we will do a PCR nasal swab for Covid and a chest Xx-ray and some other investigations as well and uhm, we will try to get to the bottom of what's causing your your shortness of breath."
2467,Sure I have had this cough for the past five days and it doesn't seem to be getting any better so I'm just here to ask you what it what it possibly could be.,"Has the cough been getting any better, staying the same or getting worse over these last five days?"

2511,Yes yes.,OK. And do you smoke cigarettes?
2512,I don't.,"OK and I know some people in your age group might even start using other types of substances. Have you noticed anything like that, or have you used anything like that?"
2513,"Umm, no.",OK. And so do you drink? do you drink alcohol?
2514,"I have had a sip of wine, but that's that's about it.","OK, great. And has anybody in your family had had similar symptoms?"
2515,"No, I don't think so.","OK, um and anybody in the family have asthma or lung conditions?"
2516,I think my aunt has asthma but I was I was checked for asthma when I was younger and it turns out I don't have it.,"OK, and any diseases that run in the family like genetic or congenital?"
2517,I think Crohn's disease.,"OK, and umm, who in the family has that?"
2518,My father.,"OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask today, was there anything else you wanted to tell me?"
2519,"No, that's it. What do you think I have?","Well, it is sounding like it could be most likely an infectious type of process going on with the possibility of having a fever with a cough and sore throat. So we'll do a physical exam and also some investigations which will include a covid test today. Because some of these symptoms do overlap, but it could be something like the common cold. I don't know the virus that's bringing this on but it's not necessarily covid. But because we're doing the test, it will require 14 days of self isolation. We'll get back to you with the results as quickly as we can."
2520,"Sure, my 5 year old daughter, I noticed that she's been coughing a lot over the past two days. She sounds like she has a stuffy nose and now she's got this pink eye so I just wanted to get it checked out by you.","Yeah, for sure. So the cough started 5 days ago?"
2521,Two days ago.,OK and is the cough barky or harsh sounding?
2522,"Yes, it sounds harsh.","OK, alright was there anything that changed two days ago that might have triggered the cough?"
2523,"I don't think so, although she does go to daycare.","OK, uh and so has she been bringing up any sputum with the cough?"
2524,"No, no sputum that I've noticed.","OK, notice any blood?"
2525,No.,"Alright, and is the cough worse at any particular time of day?"
2526,No.,"OK, and has there been any wheezing?"
2527,"No, not that I noticed.",OK. And you mentioned the red eyes. When did you notice that?
2528,That was just yesterday.,"OK, any discharge from the eyes?"
2529,No.,"OK, nothing like that? No tearing or anything like that?"
2530,No.,OK. Umm and has she complained about any like changes to vision?
2531,She's been rubbing it and so it's possibly itchy.,OK. And have you noticed any mucus coming out?
2532,"Umm, no, it's actually stuffy.",OK
2533,"Yeah, not so much mucous.","OK, has she mentioned anything about losing smell?"

2535,She just sounds like she's congested.,OK. Umm any sore throat?
2536,"Umm, possibly.","OK, how has she been eating?"
2537,"Um, she's been eating OK. I guess she's been eating alittle less than usual.","OK umm, would you say that she's been going to the bathroom as often as normal?"
2538,"Yep, I would say so.","No changes there, OK. Um and has she had any loss of taste?"
2539,"Umm, possibly since she's not eating as much.",OK. Any fevers or chills?

2545,No.,"OK, and any diarrhea?\"
2546,"Umm, no.","OK, and has she mentioned anything about headaches?"
2547,No.,OK. And how about any aches or pains anywhere?
2548,"Uh, no, I don't think so.",Have you noticed any rashes?
2549,No.,"OK, and has she been diagnosed with any conditions before?"
2550,No.,OK. And any reason for her to be hospitalized?
2551,"Uh, no.","OK, um does she take any medications regularly?"
2552,"Um, no.","OK, does she have any allergies to medications?"
2553,"Umm, no.","Alright, any surgeries before?"
2554,"Umm, no.",Any concerns with her growth or development?
2555,"Umm, no, everything's been pretty normal.","OK, and any concerns about her vision or hearing?"
2556,No.,OK. And can tell you tell me a little bit about the living situation currently? Are you the primary caregiver?
2557,I am.,"OK, and who else is in the home?"
2558,Her father.,"OK, are there any pets around?"
2559,No.,Alright. And does anybody in the house smoke?
2560,"No, no one smokes.","OK, any exposures in the house to like carpets or dust or inhalants that might bring on a cough?"
2561,No.,OK. Ummm and uhh anybody in the family been sick?
2562,No.,"OK, and how about anybody you mentioned at the daycare? Was anybody been sick there?"
2563,"No, I don't think so. I contacted them and checked, but it seems like no one's been sick.","OK, and you say you haven't traveled anywhere?"
2564,"Oh no, no, not recently.",OK. And any lung conditions or heart conditions that run in the family?
2565,No.,"OK, and how about any genetic conditions or congenital conditions in the family?"
2566,"No, none, none that I know of.","OK, so the main symptoms are the cough that started two days ago and also you've noticed she's been congested. And sorry, what was the last symptom?"
2567,She has this pink eye and she has a cough.,"Yeah, right, that could be conjunctivitis. OK, so at this point we will certainly run some investigations to look into what this could be. It sounds like a viral infectious type of process, especially if it's involving the eyes, nose, and and with a cough. And so we will test with a swab for covid for sure. But it could be something more common, like the common cold. We just need to make sure that we're comprehensive in that with the testing."
2568,"It seems to be a little bit worse at night. He'll have this cough during the day. Sometimes I'll notice when he's playing. He's had these coughing fits that last for up to a minute but usually recovers from. He hasn't been too active to be honest. He's been a little bit slowed down these last couple of days, but in regards to consistency, I'd say it's a little bit worse at night.","OK, any other triggers like dust or the cold air? Anything like that?"
2569,"I haven't really noticed anything. We've been mainly keeping inside due to covid, right? I think my wife left a window open the other night, and maybe the cough was a little bit better. I'm not sure. It's kind of hard to tell when we sleep.","Yeah, have you tried anything for it, like have you given him any over the counter cough medications?"
2570,"No, we're a little scared to give him anything. He's so young. He's 2 1/2. We haven't been really giving him any medications to be honest.","OK, good. And if you were to describe the quality of this cough, would you say it's barky? Is it harsh?"
2571,"Barky might be a good word to describe it, like he's had colds before his coughs were quiet but this sounds harsh. It sounds like he's really trying to cough hard there. Very violent sometimes.",OK OK. And has he ever had a cough like this in the past?
2572,"No, never.","OK, and then in terms of the timeline, is it getting worse? His cough?"
2573,"I think it has been to be honest. He was a little ill like he had a runny nose a couple of days ago, maybe two days ago and then the cough started but it only really started getting noticeably different about the night of the first day, about two days ago so. Now it's been more present I suppose,than it was when he just first had it.","OK, and is it a dry cough or does he bring up sputum?"
2574,"Sputum like phlegm,no he doesn't bring anything up really, so dry.",OK so no blood as well right?
2575,No blood.,"OK,  does he have any shortness of breath with his cough?"
2576,"I feel like when he has the coughing fits, he's winded. He's weak after them. Sometimes he cries after them or before the middle can be a trigger for it, but just resting normally, he doesn't seem that out of breath, no.",OK any wheeziness?
2577,"No, not really. He's able to breathe. I can't really hear him breathing that much. Sometimes at night after a bad cough he'll be really winded. And yeah, it does sound like a little different when he's breathing, but just right now he sounds normal.","OK, and any reason for you to think he has chest pain?"
2578,"He hasn't any sort of chest pain. He says his throat hurts, but I don't think it's his chest.",Has he had any fevers?
2579,"No, no rashes.",How about weight loss?
2580,"No weight loss, he's a fairly healthy kid.",And his vision and hearing are normal?
2581,"You know, I haven't gotten him formally assessed yet, but seems to be able to read pretty well from a distance. He's not in school yet, but I haven't noticed anything, and he can hear fine. I think he responds when I call.","OK, has he had a stuffy or runny nose?"
2582,"Yeah yeah, that's kind of how it first started three days ago. Maybe had a runny nose. OK, yeah.",Does he still have a runny nose?
2583,"Umm, a little bit less now. No, not as much now.","OK. And his taste, any reason to believe there are any changes there?"
2584,"Well, we've been kind of spoiling him a bit, just giving him ice cream. His throat hurts a little bit and he seems to still like it, so it's hard to tell.","OK, so he has a little bit of a sore throat as well?"
2585,Yeah.,"OK OK, and then any dizziness or fainting spells that you've noticed?"
2586,"No fainting or dizzy spells, but he's really gassed after he has like a coughing fit and he doesn't want to stand up, he'll just be sitting down or he wants to be held.","OK, is he more irritable than usual?"
2587,"Yeah after he has a bad coughing fit, he wants to be soothed and he'll be crying, but it's just more of because he's worn out, I believe he's tired.","Yeah, OK, and then any confusion or memory loss?"
2588,No.,"OK, and then in terms of his bowel movements, have things been normal from that standpoint?"
2589,"Oh yeah, process of potty training him, but no, no real changes.","OK, so no diarrhea, no constipation, no blood in the stool?"
2590,No.,OK and he's passing gas?
2591,OK yeah I'd say so.,Any nausea or vomiting?
2592,"No. We haven't been really feeding him solid meals, it's because he's been sick, we've been trying to give him soup and liquids for the most part because his throat hurts, but he's able to keep them down. So no, no nausea, no vomiting.","OK, and then how about changes in his appetite?"
2593,"Yeah, he's not eating as much but still, we're trying to force food into him to keep his energy up. Most of time he always will be asking for snacks in the afternoon, but now not so much.",OK. Alright and any anything else that I missed that he's been experiencing over the past few days?
2594,"No, just the cough.","OK, and then he otherwise healthy? Does he have any longstanding medical conditions?"
2595,"No longstanding medical conditions. Yeah, nothing really. We had a little bit of stay in the NICU, just because he was a little bit underweight, but no, nothing really.",OK. And then his mother's pregnancy with him? Any complications at that point?
2596,Yeah he's a little pre term. 34 weeks I think.,"OK, was he also underweight too?  You mentioned just a little bit."
2597,Yeah.,"OK, and any complications during the actual delivery?"
2598,"Yeah, not that I remember like she started going to labor early, like earlier than we expected. We thought it was just a regular contraction and that it will just resolve but she wound up proceeding when we showed up at the hospital","OK and then in terms of growth, weight and head circumference, has he been hitting all those milestones for the past 2 1/2 years?"
2599,"Yeah, we we bring him to the family doctor every couple of month for his regular checkups and nothing has been brought up to be concerning for his vaccines. He has been doing well.","OK and then how about other milestones like speech, movement, fine movement, all of that, like have those been normal? Is he on par with his peers?"
2600,"Yeah, this is our first kid, but compared to his cousins he seems to be doing well. He's speaking, he's got little sentences, now he has good eye contact. He's a good kid.","OK, good good. Any hospitalizations or surgeries aside from when he was born?"
2601,No no.,OK good and is he on any medications?
2602,"No, OK we give him like a flintstone gummy.","OK, is he up to date with all his immunizations?"
2603,Yeah.,Any allergies?
2604,Not that we know of.,Any family history of lung conditions?
2605,"So my grandfather, so his greatgrandfather I suppose passed away from lung cancer. He was a heavy smoker though. On my mom's side there's some breast cancer. No,  nothing really that comes to mind for lungs.",And any heart conditions?
2606,"No, not that we know of.",And how about other cancers?
2607,"No, not that I know of.","OK, how about asthma, eczema or allergies in the family?"
2608,"You know, I think my sister is allergic to peas, but she was never sick from them like go to the hospital.  I don't think there are any allergies in the family.","OK, good, has he been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?"
2609,"You know, like 5 days ago we had a playdate with his cousin. And we kind of thought that that's where he got the cold from. Like the runny nose, but it just turned weird, you know.",OK and how's this cousin doing?
2610,"Last time I talked to Charlotte, Hank seems to be doing well so.","Alright, and has he traveled to anywhere recently? Have you any of you traveled anywhere recently?"
2611,"No, with covid and everything, we have just been keeping to ourselves.",And with who and where does he live?
2612,He lives with me and his mother in a house,OK. Any old carpets or mold or concerns for asbestos? Anything like that at home?
2613,I don't know when this house is built. I don't think there's any asbestos in it and it's all hardwood. So no.,"OK, good. Anyone at home smoke?"
2614,"No, no.","OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had. Do you have any questions for me?"
2615,"No, no that's it, no.","OK, well, from the sounds of it, he most likely has some sort of viral infection. We will do a COVID swap to rule that out because some symptoms do seem to overlap with COVID and we want to make sure to rule that out. So we'll take a swab. Those PCR results should come back in about 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, he should isolate for 14 days at home and if it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection like parainfluenza, also known as croup. So for that, for any of these viral infections, actually the best treatment is to stay at home and make sure that he's very well hydrated and eating well. If his symptoms persist for three to five days or more, or if his symptoms worsen, especially if he has like a seizure or urological issues, he should go to the ER and if his symptoms do become worse, we can also prescribe him some steroids or epinephrine just to open up his airways. And if it's really, really bad he might be hospitalised as well. So just keep an eye on on that for now. And if you have any"
2616,"A little scary. Sounds good. OK, I'll just keep an eye on him for the next five days.",Give us a call if his symptoms are becoming worse or if they're not resolving and we will try to do an assessment on him. Of course we will do a physical exam today and will let you know how severe his symptoms are. Most children will get over their infection on their own and he likely won't need any additional treatments.
2617,"OK, sounds good.",Alright take care.
2618,"Hi, yes I just came in today because I've been a bit concerned about some breathing difficulties over the last few days. It all started out with like a cough over the last week, but now I'm having trouble breathing as well.","Oh OK, well I'm sorry to hear that. So you said a cough as well, so the cough at least a week back and the shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, when did that start?"
2619,"So yeah, the cough, I usually have a cough. I've had COPD for a long time, but this past week the coughing has been much worse with a lot of more sputum and. Other than that, it started I would say two to three days ago. The cough got worse and then every time I'm moving around I like have to sit down and catch my breath, which is pretty abnormal for me.","OK yeah, so alright. So let's focus on the cough first. You said it's a wet cough?"
2620,"Yes, I am producing a lot of sputum.","OK, what color is your sputum?"
2621,It's mainly like clear white.,OK yeah so you don't see yellow pus or anything green or bloody in there?
2622,"No, I don't think so. But there's definitely like a lot more than what I usually produce.","OK, umm this cough, does it sound harsh, barky or does it sound muffled?"
2623,I would say it's a bit harsh at times. I wouldn't say it's barky or muffled. I do find myself wheezing a little over the last few days as well.,OK. Do you find you have any chest pain associated with the shortness of breath?
2624,"Oh no, I don't really have any pains.","OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this before?"
2625,"I did a couple of years ago, I had to be admitted because I had some shortness of breath.",OK.
2626,"But that was, I think, two years ago.","OK. And when you were admitted two years ago, did they tell you what you had?"
2627,"Yeah, they said I had some kind of lung infection at that time, so they gave me some antibiotics while I was in the hospital.","OK, did they ever say to you that you had anything else like asthma, COPD, any longstanding conditions?"
2628,Yeah so I've had COPD for more than... I guess more than 10 years now so I think it just got a lot worse with the infection.,"OK yeah alright. So this time around, have you had any fevers?"
2629,I've been having a couple of chills but like they would come and go. I didn't really think it was a fever.,"OK, any weight loss?"
2630,No.,"OK, how about changes in your hair or nails like or or skin like rashes?"
2631,"Umm, no.",Any changes in your vision or hearing?
2632,Nope.,And how about smell or taste?
2633,"Umm, no. I think they're the same.",OK. Have a stuffy nose or runny nose?
2634,"I do feel a bit stuffy, but it's not too bad.",OK. And any swelling in your in your legs or upper limbs?
2635,"No, not that I know.",How about calf pain?
2636,Nope.,Dizziness or fainting spells?
2637,No.,Headaches?
2638,No headaches.,Memory loss or confusion?
2639,Nope.,Changes in your bowel movement or abdominal pain?
2640,Nope.,Changes to urinating?
2641,"No, that's all fine","OK, so besides the COPD, do you have any other longstanding conditions?"
2642,"I do have some high blood pressure which I take, I think I take one of these medications called metoprolol.","OK, and when was the last time you had your blood pressure checked?"
2643,"Umm, probably like a month ago and it was pretty good. I've been checking by myself at home too and it hasn't been changing too much. I think the last one I took was probably like 135 / 80.","Oh, I see. OK, any hospitalizations besides the one that you had for COPD a year back?"
2644,"Umm, back when I was a kid I had my tonsils removed.","OK, are you on any medications besides the metoprolol?"
2645,"I do take multivitamins.I think that's yeah, that's about it.",Do you take any puffers for your COPD?
2646,"Yeah, so I do have three like different puffers I take. I can't remember the name. I do have some puffers I don't take. I've been using them right now. It has been helping with some of my shortness of breath, but I've definitely been having to use them way more than I used to.",OK. Do you know which puffer you're on?
2647,"Yeah, so I think one of them is called ventolin. OK, and then I think the second one is called the Spiriva.","OK, sure, Yep."
2648,So one of them should be a short acting beta agonist.,"Just wanna make sure that you have one with a long acting and then the other one is a long acting beta agonist. OK, good. Alright, are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
2649,"Yeah, I think so.",And are you allergic to anything?
2650,"No, not that I know.",Any family history of lung conditions?
2651,"Umm, no I don't think so. Yeah, no, I don't think so.",OK. How about heart conditions?
2652,"Yeah, my father died of a heart attack in his 60s.","OK. Alright, any cancers?"
2653,My uncle had skin cancer.,"OK. Do you know what type of skin cancer like melanoma, basal cell, squamous cell?"
2654,"No, I think it wasn't the bad one. It was like the one they can remove right away.","Oh I see. OK, OK, that's good.Do you smoke?"
2655,"Yeah, I've been smoking for around, I would say the last 20 years.","OK, how much do you smoke?"
2656,Probably I would say pack a day for the last 20 years.,"Umm, have you ever thought about quitting?"
2657,"Yeah I did. I did once and then went back onto it. I definitely do smoke less than before though. OK, but yeah, I don't think I'm ready to quit yet.","OK, yeah no problem. Do you drink alcohol?"
2658,"Umm, yeah, maybe once a week I would have a small Cup of whiskey.","OK, sure, that's fine. And any other drugs?"
2659,"No, no marijuana, no other drugs.","OK, and where do you live right now?"
2660,Right now I live in a small bungalow in London.,"OK, any reasons to believe there are carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, anything that could be triggering your COPD?"
2661,"Umm, I don't think so. Everything is pretty up to date.","OK, have you had any contact with anyone that's been sick recently?"
2662,"No, I've been mostly trying to isolate and like just be in my own home.","OK, how about travel to anywhere?"
2663,"Nope, I've been in Ontario since the beginning of the pandemic.","Yeah OK, that makes sense. Well, those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?"
2664,"Yeah, I was just worried if it can be COVID or if it's just like another infection that I had like before.","Yeah, so we're definitely going to do a COVID swab on you and those results should take about 24 to 48 hours to come back to you. And in the meantime, because your symptoms do overlap with COVID, you should isolate for 14 days. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive to do some contact tracing. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's been going around during this time of year which is likely because you have COPD, since you're already coughing more than you usually are and seeing more sputum. We will reassess to see whether your puffers are working. If we need to add any additional things like inhaled corticosteroids as well as antibiotics and so just keep an eye on your symptoms for now and will also want to do probably a chest X Ray and possibly a pulmonary function test. How does that sound?"
2665,Thank you.,OK yeah no problem.
2666,"So yeah, I've just been having a cough for the last week and I think I had a little bit of a fever in the last few days.","OK, so you said the cough started a week ago?"
2667,"Yeah, around a week ago OK and the fever started two to three days ago. Yeah, I haven't really measured it, but like I definitely have been feeling chills.I've been wearing like multiple blankets over the last few days.","Ok, have you taken your temperature? You said you haven't taken your temperature right?"
2668,No.,OK. So let's focus on the cough. Is it persistent or does it come and go?
2669,I think the cough is pretty persistent over the last week.,"OK, and does it get worse with like cold air or dust? Like maybe pets or anything like that?"
2670,"No, I think it stays around the same.","OK, umm, does it get better with anything? Have you tried any over the counter cough syrup?"
2671,"Yes, I tried tylenol cold and liked it. I think it made it a bit better, like it helped me sleep. Other than that, during the day, it's still around the same.","OK, and how would you describe this cough? Is it barky? Is it harsh? Does it sound muffled?"
2672,How I would say is that it's kind of like it's not too harsh. It's more like a wet cough. I'm definitely bringing up some some sputum.,"OK, um, what color is the sputum?"
2673,"It's usually like a, uh like a white and sometimes like a little bit yellow as well.","OK, is it ever green or do you ever see blood in there?"
2674,"No, I haven't seen any of that.",OK. And have you ever had a cough like this before?
2675,"Umm, yeah, probably like in the last year, maybe I have gotten sick like once and had a similar cough.","OK, do you have a sore throat?"
2676,"No, I don't have a sore throat.",Is this cough getting worse?
2677,"It's, I think not really, it stayed around the same and I definitely feel a bit better with the tylenol cold.","OK, good. Any changes in your taste or smell?"

2698,No.,Are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any longstanding medical conditions?

2714,"No, it's a fairly new apartment.","OK, and well those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions for me?"
2715,You don't think it could be COVID right? Like my wife got tested and it was negative.,Are you concerned about that?
2716,"Yeah, for sure.","Honestly, some of your symptoms do seem to be overlapping with that of COVID, especially the cough and fever. So we are going to do a COVID swab just to rule that out. So you will get those results in 24 to 48 hours and you should isolate for 14 days because your symptoms overlap. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive just to do some contact tracing. But if it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's going around at this time of year so keep an eye on your symptoms. If they become worse, or if you're experiencing symptoms like neurological deficits or weakness or seizures or anything like that, get help from the ER right away and if your symptoms are persisting beyond like seven days to 10 days, also you should give us a call back to see what's going on because it could be something like a bacterial infection, in which case we can give you some antibiotics. Does that sound OK?"
2717,"OK, great. Thank you.",Thank you.
2718,"Hi, yes it's nice to meet you. I've been having this cough that's been going on for the last few days and I have had difficulty breathing.","Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. When did this start?"
2719,"Oh, so the cough started about 3 days ago. Yeah, the shortness of breath has come on since then.","OK, well let's focus on the shortness of breath first and then we'll talk about your cough as well. So you noticed that you had difficulties with breathing sometime within the past three days. When do you find that it's difficult for you to breathe? Is there anything that makes breathing more difficult for you?"
2720,"Yeah, not really. Actually, it's been well, but just bad after I cough.",So say walking up the stairs or doing any exercise doesn't make it worse?
2721,"Not really, I've been able to do the same amounts of of activity I guess.","OK, so there's really no relationship with activity with your shortness of breath. OK, and I can see that you're able to sort of talk in full sentences.  OK, how is it making it difficult for you to do things at home, your difficulty breathing?"
2722,"I am a little bit, I mean, I feel I just haven't been feeling very good overall so I've been resting these last couple of days mostly.","OK, and your cough, you said that started three days ago. Is it a dry cough or wet cough?"
2723,It's dry. It's a dry cough.,"OK, and there's no sputum production with it? Anything coming up at all?"
2724,"No, I haven't noticed anything like that.","OK, and is there anything that's making the cough better? Did you take anything? Any medications for it?"
2725,I tried some over the counter stuff but it didn't help.,"OK alright. Other than the difficulty breathing and the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms?"
2726,"Yeah, I've been really tired. I guess I've just sort of been  resting the these last few days and I've had a headache as well.",OK. Can you tell me a bit more about your headache?
2727,"Yeah, it feels like somebody is just squeezing the top of or just squeezing the sides of my head.",Have you had a headache like this before?
2728,"I have, yeah. I usually get them when I'm dehydrated. Or maybe I haven't slept well. And that's also been the case for the past two to three days. Yeah, it's been kind of off and on, there are some times that are worse than others, but I've noticed that I had it for the most part for the last few days, OK,",Have you taken anything for your headache? Any pain meds?
2729,"Yeah, I've been taking some Advil, it's helped.","And so you talked about being tired, having a headache, difficulties breathing, and coughing over the past three days. Have any of these symptoms gotten worse overtime?"
2730,"Yes, I would say, but both the cough and the shortness of breath has been getting worse over these last few days.","OK, and have you had any chills or have you checked your temperature?"
2731,"I haven't checked my temperature, but I felt like I've had a fever or might be getting a fever.",We can check your temperature here. And have you had any muscle aches?
2732,"Yeah, I guess I felt a bit achy.",Any redness in the eyes? Or any runny nose or sore throat like flu-like symptoms?
2733,"Umm, I have, I don't know maybe my nose is a little bit congested, but not really running.",OK. And have you had any change in your sense of smell?
2734,"No, I haven't noticed that.",What about your sense of taste? Are you able to taste things?
2735,"Yeah, I think so.",Have you noticed any rash anywhere on your body?
2736,"Umm, no,  I haven't.","OK, any changes in your bowel movement, diarrhea or constipation?"
2737,"No, no, nothing like that.",Any chest pain?
2738,"No, I haven't had any.","OK. Alright, well it sounds like you have multiple symptoms right now that started about 3 days ago. You're feeling tired, you have a headache, difficulties breathing, some muscle aches and you've been feeling feverish. You've also had this cough, and your nose is feeling congested. Is there anything else that that you've been experiencing over the past three days that I haven't talked about yet?"
2739,"No, as you mentioned, the headache's there too, then yeah, that's everything.","OK, umm, alright, can you tell me about your past medical history? Do you have any medical conditions?"
2740,"Yeah, I have asthma and GERD I think.","Umm, does the shortness of breath that you're experiencing feel similar to the asthma attacks in any way?"
2741,"No, I haven't had any issues with like asthma attacks in a long time.",Do you have an inhaler?
2742,I do but I don't use it very often.,"I see, did you use it over the past three days at all?"
2743,Yeah I did try it and it didn't really seem to help that much.,"Uh, and other than that, have you had any any surgeries in the past?"
2744,"Uh, I had a colonoscopy two years ago.",Any reason for that?
2745,"Uhh, my father had colon cancer when he was in his 60s.","I see OK, and any hospitalizations?"
2746,No.,"OK. Do you take any medications? I know you have puffers. Any medications, including over the counter pills?"
2747,"Yeah, I'll take like a Zantac or like Tums sometimes for reflux.","And, uh, any allergies to food, medications, or environmental allergies?"
2748,"Yeah, I have environmental allergies. I think like usually they come on in the springtime.","In terms of family histories, you did mention that your dad had colon cancer. Any other medical problems that that run in your family?"
2749,"Umm, no.",OK. And do you currently smoke?
2750,"No, I don't and have never smoked in the past.","OK, what about marijuana?"
2751,"Umm, no.","OK, do you or have you ever had alcohol?"
2752,"I will have some wine on the weekends, maybe a glass or two with dinner.","OK, sounds good and have you ever had any street drugs?"
2753,"Like a long time ago, maybe when I was in college, once or twice.","Alright, sounds good, and have you had any contact with any sick people? Anyone who's sick recently?"
2754,"Not that I know of. I mean, I went to a few stores here and there that I had been going to. I've been working from home so maybe at one of the stores. And I would imagine I were wearing a mask and of course trying to maintain social distancing as much as possible. But yeah, you never, really know.",What about any other travels or any travels at all outside the city or the country recently?
2755,"Umm, no, I had been at home.",Alright. So I guess that's all I wanted to know. I'll go talk to the attending and we'll come back and do a physical exam and maybe ask a couple more questions and then discuss the management with you. Does that sound good to you?
2756,"Yeah, that sounds great.",Thank you. OK alright.
2757,I'm doing OK. Thank you. How are you?,I'm well thanks. What brings you in today?
2758,"So, usually we go to my favorite pizza spot for lunch and these last couple of days I've noticed I just can't taste it.","OK, when you say the past couple of days, do you mean two days, three days, four days?"
2759,"I would say the last two days, yeah, just yesterday and today.","OK, so loss of taste, so you can't taste anything or you can only taste some things or you're just not getting the full depth of your taste?"
2760,"Yeah, I really noticed it with the pizza, but with like other things too, it's just a yeah, really plain, it doesn't  really have any flavor with the food that I'm eating.","OK, so it kind of tastes like cardboard."
2761,"Yeah, kind of, and I think, like, I mean part of that is that I maybe not smelling it as well either.","Yeah, OK. Umm, did you have any trauma to the area like the mouth area or the nose area in the past couple of days or days leading up to that?"
2762,"Umm, no, not at all, no.",OK and do you have a fever at all?
2763,"Umm, I don't think so no.","OK, you have a cough?"
2764,"Yeah, I've had a cough.","OK, a similar timeline?"

2777,No.,No blood in your stool?

2786,"Umm, a little bit dizzy I when I got out of bed this morning, but we sat back down for a couple of minutes. I felt better.","OK, good good. Do you think that this morning you were dizzy because you were dehydrated? Or is this like a normal thing for you?"
2787,"I mean, I guess I could have been dehydrated. I didn't even think of that, but I mean, since the food didn't taste so great, I don't know. I probably didn't eat as much yesterday or the last couple of days. Maybe I haven't eaten as much.","OK, Yep. OK, do you feel weak?"
2788,"I don't know, maybe. Maybe a little weak, but umm, just way more tired.","OK, any confusion or memory loss?"

2794,"Umm, no muscle aches.",Have you been around anyone who's been sick recently?
2795,Yeah there is this guy in my class who was sick in class last week.,What kind of symptoms did he have?
2796,"Well, he had a cough and fever. Yeah, I think he had a cough and a fever and somebody said that. Maybe a sore throat or something like that.","OK, so yeah, some symptoms overlap with yours I guess. Have you traveled anywhere recently?"
2797,"Oh no, I've been at home. We just started back at going in person to school again.","OK, that's good. And are you otherwise healthy?"
2798,"Yeah, I haven't been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past.","Oh good, OK. And do you have any allergies?"

2808,It's like a few times a day.,"OK, and is there any tobacco in there or nicotine?"
2809,"I think there might be, but umm, I don't know. I usually just buy the flavored ones.","OK, well, you should probably look into if it has tobacco or nicotine, because neither of those are good for your health. And so we can, you know, have a discussion later on trying to cut down or quitting completely if you are open to that."
2810,"Yeah, sure.",I'll just continue on asking you some other questions. Do you drink alcohol?
2811,"Umm, no.",And who do you live with?
2812,"I live with my mom, my step dad, and then my younger sister.","OK, do you guys live in a house?"

2814,"Yeah, yeah, I live close. I go to high school not too far from here.","Oh, that's nice. And any concerns with the living arrangements in terms of you know, like it being an old building, old carpets, mold, anything like that?"
2815,"No, I live in a nice place. It's usually like really clean.","OK, good, umm alright, so those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions or any concerns that you wanted to bring up?"
2816,I guess the only thing that I was concerned about was possibly having COVID.,"Yeah, you know, that's probably top on my list of things to investigate you for, so I would say COVID or other viral illnesses that could be going around this time of year. That would have less of a similar presentation, and so we will do a COVID swab for you. And in the meantime, if you could isolate for 14 days, regardless of whether the swab comes back positive or negative, and that would be great. If the swab comes back positive, we will notify public health and they'll try to trace where you could have caught this from and if it turns out it's not a viral illness, we will try to work you up for any bacterial infections which can be treated with antibiotics. So that's where we will start, does that sound good?"
2817,"Yeah, that makes sense.","OK great, well have a great day."
2818,"Oh, not too great I've had this cough the last few days.","OK, umm, how old are you?"
2819,I'm 36.,"OK, so for the past couple of days you said, so is that two days? Three days?"
2820,I think 3 three days.,OK and is it a dry cough or are you bringing up anything?
2821,It's dry.,"OK, so no sputum, no blood?"
2822,No blood.,OK and do you feel wheezy at all?
2823,"No, no wheezing.",No  shortness of breath?
2824,Now I ran to catch the bus yesterday and I was a bit more short of breath than I would usually be.,"OK, and have you had a fever?"
2825,I've felt hot yes.,"OK, did you actually take your temperature or do you just feel hot?"
2826,I just got hot.,OK so we can take your temperature today. Any chest pain?
2827,No chest pain.,"OK, and any throat pain?"
2828,"Yeah, my throat's been a little sore, but I thought it was maybe just because I was coughing so much.",OK and any issues swallowing food?
2829,"Umm, no problems swallowing food.","OK, any changes in your smell?"
2830,"Now that you mention it, yeah I thought it was maybe just plugged up, but I haven't really been able to smell these last few days.","OK, and how about hearing? Any changes in your hearing?"
2831,No changes there.,OK any ear pain?
2832,"No ear pain, no.","OK, any changes in your vision?"

2837,"No, everything's been regular there.","OK, no diarrhea, no constipation, no blood in your stool?"
2838,"No diarrhea, no constipation, and I haven't noticed any blood.","OK, any changes in your urine?"
2839,"Uh, no.","No, OK. Um, how about muscle aches or pains?"
2840,"I felt pretty, uh, well, yeah, I guess achy and weak.",Did that start around the same time that you experienced your cough and possible fever?
2841,":Yeah, I would say it started around the same time.","OK, any dizziness?"
2842,"Uh, no.",Any confusion or memory loss?
2843,No.,"OK, any fainting spells?"
2844,No.,Any rashes?
2845,I haven't noticed any rashes.,"OK, so it's your cough and just in general how you feel. Does it get better or worse with anything? Have you tried you know Tylenol and any antipyretics?"
2846,"Yeah, I tried some uh like day and night time Tylenol at home to sleep but still, when I woke up in the morning, still not feeling very good and the cough is still here too.","OK, yeah. Have you ever experienced anything like this before?"
2847,"Maybe as a kid. I mean, I remember getting the flu. I had a cough and that sort of thing, but I haven't been sick for several years now.","OK. Umm, and then since you started having this cough too, now has anything changed? How are you feeling worse? Or do you feel kind of the same as when it started?"
2848,I would say I feel a bit worse.,"OK, and has anyone around you been sick recently?"
2849,"Umm, no, not that I know of. Yeah, everybody in the house has been OK.","OK, have you traveled anywhere recently?"
2850,"Umm, yeah, I was visiting some cousins up North several weeks ago, but that was just traveling within the province.","OK, and they're fine? No one is sick?"
2851,I haven't heard of anybody being sick.,"OK, and are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any medical conditions?"
2852,I've been told I had high cholesterol before. But I don't take any medications for it. I've been just trying to lose some weight and exercise more.,"Sure, OK. No surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?"
2853,No.,OK and no other medications?
2854,"Umm, no,  I just take a multivitamin.","Ok, and no other you know over the counter medications or herbal stuff?"
2855,"No, I'll use my Tylenol or Ibuprofen or Advil I guess if I get the occasional headache.  And I guess, umm, something like Reactine or Claritin for the seasonal allergies but that's about it.",OK. And so you said seasonal allergies. Any other allergies?
2856,"Umm, no, just usually like in the springtime.","OK, and are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
2857,Yeah I am. Yeah I get the flu shot every year.,"OK good. And in terms of family history, do any of your family members have lung conditions or heart conditions?"
2858,"I know mom has high blood pressure, but nobody's had a heart attack or, uh, no lung conditions either.","OK, any cancers that run in the family?"
2859,"Umm, none, I can't think of any.","OK, and then do you smoke?"
2860,I just I smoke cannabis every once in awhile.,"OK, how much do you smoke?"
2861,"Um, I would say maybe, I enjoy it on the weekends.",Did you say a joint on the weekends?
2862,Yes.,"OK, so is that like 1 milligram?"
2863,"Yeah, I would say something about that. Yeah, it's not much.",OK. But no cigarettes though?
2864,No.,"OK, any other recreational drugs?"
2865,No.,"OK, and do you drink alcohol?"
2866,"Umm, I do, yeah, I'll have like two or three beers on the weekend.",Sure. And and where do you live?
2867,I'm just like 20 minutes down the road in a house here.,"Sure, is it an apartment complex or is it like a full house?"
2868,"Yeah, it's a single family home. I live there with my wife and three kids.","OK, um any concerns with your living arrangements you know, like old carpets or anything like that?"
2869,"Actually last year we had most of the carpets taken out, so not anymore.",OK good good. Did you have any other questions or concerns? Anything that you wanted to bring up that I didn't touch on today?
2870,"Yeah, I was just really worried that this could be COVID. I mean I have a cough and just have been feeling really hot so I was just concerned about that.","Yeah, for sure, and I think that's a valid concern. So right now I'm just going through, you know, a list of differential diagnoses that you could possibly have and COVID, it's definitely top on my list and so we will likely get a swab and run those tests and try to get that back to you as soon as we can. It could also be other respiratory infections, especially viral infections this time of the year. And so, if it comes back negative for COVID, it's probably you know something else like respiratory virus or even the flu. So we'll go from there. And if it turns out it's not a viral infection, we will likely see if it's some sort of bacterial infection in which we can prescribe antibiotics for those. But it definitely sounds like there's an infectious picture going on here because of the acuteness of the presentation, and just your symptoms. So we will do afollow up in a week or so. Until then, we will run all these labs. Does that sound good?"
2871,"Alright, yeah, that sounds good, so I guess I will kind of self isolate until the COVID results come back.","Oh yes please do so. That's that's a great point. I do suggest isolating for two weeks at least if you have any sort of symptoms, because even though the PCR that we do to test for COVID is supposed to be reliable and it's supposed to be specific and sensitive, there are sometimes false negative tests. You know, just to be on the safe side, if you're experiencing any of the symptoms that overlap with COVID symptoms, isolate for two weeks. But by the end of the week we should know what the test results are and then you will know for sure what you have."
2872,"OK, awesome, thank you.","Yeah, thank you."
2873,"So I've had a fever that I measured this morning and I had a cough.  I've had a cough these last several days. Yeah, today is Friday so it started Monday, so I guess like yeah the cough started four days ago.","OK, and the fever started four days ago as well?"
2874,"Well, I've been feeling hot this week, but I checked my temperature this morning and it was the first time I checked it and it was 38.5.","OK, so that's definitely a fever, so we can take your temperature today as well. Umm, so have your symptoms been the same or getting worse, or be getting better over the past few days?"
2875,"They are getting worse. I've been starting to feel really fatigued and, uh, tired as well and the cough has gotten worse too.","OK, have you ever felt like this before?"
2876,"I mean, maybe a really long time ago when I was a kid or something like that. Maybe I had the flu, but nothing recently.",OK. And do you have a sore throat at all?
2877,No sore throat. It does get a little scratchy with my cough but hasn't been sore.,"OK, and do you have any issues swallowing food?"
2878,"No, but I haven't been as hungry.","OK, you haven't been as hungry. Um, have you had any changes to your taste?"
2879,"No, I feel like I've been tasting my food OK.","OK, how about smell?"
2880,I feel like I've been able to smell.,"OK, do you have a runny nose or a blocked nose? Do you feel congested?"
2881,"Maybe a little runny, but not too bad.","OK, how about your hearing or vision? Any changes there?"
2882,"No, I haven't noticed anything.","OK, any pain or discharge from either your ears or eyes?"
2883,"No, nothing like that.","OK, so let's go back to the cough. Um, are you producing any sputum?"
2884,No sputum.,"OK, so it's a dry cough?"
2885,Yeah it is.,"OK, any blood associated with the cough?"
2886,I haven't seen any blood.,"OK, do you feel wheezy at all?"
2887,I haven't noticed any wheezing.,"OK, how about shortness of breath?"
2888,"Usually well, after some of my coughing fits, I can be a little bit shorter in breath, but otherwise they've been.","OK, any chest pain?"
2889,"No, I haven't had any chest pain.",Do you ever feel like your heart's racing?
2890,"No, I don't.","OK, and any night sweats or chills?"
2891,"I have felt a little chilly at night, but I haven't had any night sweats.","OK, and how about weight loss? Have you had any weight loss over the past few months?"
2892,"No, it's been about the same. Maybe down a few pounds over this week as I just haven't been eating as much.","OK, yeah. Umm, does anything make the cough better or worse?"
2893,"Umm, no, I can't think of anything.","OK, and how have your bowel movements been?"
2894,"They've, I would say they've been normal.","OK, and any abdominal pain?"
2895,"No pain, but I have been a little nauseous.","Nauseous, OK. Have you thrown up?"
2896,"No, I haven't vomited, but I've certainly felt like it a few times.","OK, and any triggers for your nausea?"
2897,"Oh I can't think of anything. It just sort of came on. And it really went away on its own pretty quickly, but uh I don't know, maybe it was when I had my headache.","OK, when when did your headache start?"
2898,"Um, so it's been on and off these last several days so I've been kind of resting a bit more too.","OK yeah, you said past several days, have you ever had headaches before that?"
2899,"Yeah, I've had, I think they're called tension headaches. I get those every so often and will take Advil or something like that for them, and they usually go away.",OK. Do these headaches feel like the same headaches?
2900,"Yeah, they they feel about the same, kind of like a pressure or vice grip on my head.","OK, so it's not like the worst headache you've ever experienced?"
2901,"No, I think it's just been a part of how I haven't been feeling well these these last few days.","OK, yeah. Do you feel fatigued or tired at all?"
2902,"Yeah, for sure. I haven't really had any changes, but just haven't been really getting my work done throughout the day because I have just been feeling so tired.","Yeah, umm, and do you feel any sort of body aches that go along with your fatigue?"
2903,Maybe a little.,"OK. Umm, can you think of anything that may have caused your symptoms? You know, have you been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?"
2904,"I can't think of anybody I've been around who's been sick, but last weekend I went shopping in the mall so I went into quite a few stores.","OK, and you were wearing your mask? Everyone else was wearing their mask?"
2905,"Yeah, everybody far as I could tell.","OK, have you traveled anywhere recently?"
2906,"Uh, no, I've just been home.","OK, I just want to ask you a few more questions. Any memory loss or confusion?"
2907,No.,Any dizziness or fainting spells?
2908,"Nothing like that, no.",OK. Are you otherwise healthy?
2909,"Um, yeah I've well, I've been told I had high cholesterol so I've been taking Rosuvastatin for that the past few years.","OK, and is it helping with the cholesterol levels?"
2910,"Yeah, the last time I was at the family doctor I was told they were at a good level. O","OK, good."
2911,I'm sorry I'm pre-diabetic as well.,"OK, when was the last time you had blood work done?"
2912,"I think, uh six months ago.","OK, and that's when you were told you were pre-diabetic?"
2913,"Yeah, I think my A1C was like 6.2% so uh, on the cusp.","OK, yeah, that's understandable. Um, have you made any sort of lifestyle changes to get your blood glucose under control?"
2914,"Well, I have been walking the dog more. he weather is getting better and trying to eat out less often. Yeah, I've been trying to lose weight, but it it's been yeah, relatively stable still.","K, we can review some options with you later on in the visit if you would like."
2915,"Yeah, certainly we can talk about that later.","OK, sounds good. Have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?"
2916,Yeah I had an inguinal hernia repaired about five years ago.,And are you on any medications?
2917,Just Rosuvastatin right now.,"OK, and any over the counter medications or herbal supplements?"
2918,Just a multi vitamin.,"OK, umm, do you have any allergies?"
2919,Penicillin. I break out in hives.,"OK, and did you need to be treated with any sort of antibiotics recently?"
2920,"No, no, I haven't had any antibiotics for a long time.","OK, and are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
2921,"I am, yeah, I get the flu shot every year.","OK, good. An yeah, that's really good. Um, do you know if you have any family history of any lung conditions or heart conditions?"
2922,"No, I don't think so.","OK, how about cancers in the family?"
2923,"I think my grandfather had bladder cancer, but, uh, I'm not sure.","OK, and I forget if I asked you earlier, but have you had any changes to your urinary habits, any changes in your urine itself or voiding frequency?"
2924,"No, I haven't had any changes there and I haven't noticed any like blood or color changes. No pain.","OK, great. And do you smoke?"
2925,"Um, no I do not.","OK, how about marijuana?"
2926,Nope.,Any other recreational drug?
2927,"No, I just have a few beers on the weekend. Like probably I don't know two or three on Saturday and Sunday.","OK, and where do you live?"
2928,I live in a like duplex and rent the basement in a house nearby.,"OK, do you live with anyone?"
2929,"Yeah, I live with my girlfriend.","OK, and um, any concerns for you know old carpets or mold or asbestos in the duplex that you're living in?"
2930,"Not in our unit so I mean, maybe upstairs, but if it's anything like our place, then no.",OK. I think those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or concerns that you wanted to bring up before we end the interview?
2931,"Uh, no, well  I guess I was just concerned about about COVID.","Yeah, you know that's the top on my list of differential diagnosis for you. So what we'll do is a COVID swab and that should come back in a day or so, but we do encourage isolation for 14 days and that includes from your girlfriend as well. So even if the COVID swab comes back negative, sometimes it can be false negative, so as long as you're having these symptoms, and these symptoms are common in COVID,  we do ask that you isolate for 14 days if the swab comes back positive. We will also notify public health so that they can get in touch with you and do some contact tracing to see where you may have gotten COVID from, but other than that, if it's not COVID, it could likely be another upper respiratory viral illness because of this time of year. A lot of different viruses are going around like common viruses or the flu, you know, so it could be one of those. And then if you're still sick or your symptoms change, we can reassess to make sure it's not a bacterial infection or bacterial pneumonia, in which case we can prescribe antibiotics."
2932,"OK yeah, thank you for all that information. Sounds great.","OK, well take care then, alright."
2933,"I'm not so good, these last few days I haven't benn able to reallykeep anything down and not feeling so good.","OK, I'm sorry to hear that. Um, when you say last few days, did you mean the past two days? 3 days?"
2934,"Well, I feel like maybe the last five days I just haven't been feeling so good and I haven't really felt like eating. But these last two days I've been really nauseous and I've thrown up a few times.","OK, when you say you haven't been feeling good for the past five days, is it that you feel achy? Do you feel hot like you have a fever, or do you feel weak?"
2935,"Yeah, I do feel hot and um, yeah, maybe a bit tired.",Tired? OK. And nausea and vomiting. Are you throwing up or just feeling nauseous?
2936,"Mostly nauseous, but yeah, yesterday I threw up like three or four times and then again today I threw up like two or three times.","OK, are you throwing up any blood?"
2937,"No, I didn't see any red. It was mostly like yellow and umm, liquidy beacuse I haven't been eating much solids or like just like food. I've been mostly just having drinks.","OK, um, and so mostly fluid you said?"
2938,Yeah.,"OK, and what color is it?"
2939,"Uhh, yeah, usually usually kind of like yellowish clear.",OK. Are you having any abdominal pain?
2940,"Maybe like after I vomit it kind of feels like squeezing a little bit. But I think, yeah, I think yeah that's just really just with when I'm heaving.","Right, um, are you, do you have any changes in your bowel movements?"
2941,"Umm, no, I haven't noticed anything there.","OK. And so no diarrhea, no constipation?"
2942,"No, nothing like that.","OK, no blood in your stool?"
2943,"o blood, I haven't seen any red.","OK, and how about issues swallowing food?"
2944,"Oh yeah, no problem swallowing. Just haven't felt hungry.","OK, so you don't have much of an appetite then."
2945,"No, not not really.","OK, alright, so um, any changes in in taste?"
2946,"Um, maybe I mean, yeah, I think I might not be really tasting things the same.","OK, how about smell?"
2947,"Now that you say it, I might, uh, yeah I think my smell has been impacted as well. I can't really smell anything.",OK.
2948,"I thought that was kind of weird, but didn't think anything of it actually until you just asked me.",Yeah for sure. And how about any changes in your vision or hearing?
2949,No changes to vision or hearing.,"OK, any discharge?"
2950,"Uh, nothing like that that, but I mean my eyes were a bit, they've been a bit red these last two days.","OK, have they been in any pain?"
2951,"Nope, no pain and I've been able to see everything OK. It's just I just noticed they were a little bit more red. I just thought maybe I don't know I was, I've just been tired.",Yeah for sure. Any coughing?
2952,"Uhh, yeah I haven't had a cough but um, I've had a cough for a few years now, so yeah, that's not really a change for me.","Alright, so no change in your cough. Is it a dry cough or a wet cough?"
2953,"It's uh, oh, a dry cough usually.","Dry cough, OK. Any blood that you produce?"
2954,"No blood, no blood.","OK, any shortness of breath?"
2955,I'm not really able to exercise and stuff like that.,"OK, have any wheeziness?"
2956,"Um, no, I haven't had a a wheeze.","OK, how about any fatigue or tiredness?"
2957,"Yeah, I've definitely felt a little bit more kind of groggy and tired this last week, really.","OK, and muscle aches to go along with that?"
2958,"Yeah, bit in my like kind of upper arms and legs a little bit.","OK, you said you've been feeling groggy. Do you feel dizzy at all?"
2959,"Not dizzy, just maybe that I'm like moving in slow motion.","OK yeah, any confusion or memory loss?"
2960,"No, I think I've been OK.","OK, any rashes?"
2961,"No, I haven't noticed any rashes.","OK, how about headaches?"
2962,"Yeah, these last few days I've had a bit of a headache as well.It hasn't been very intense, so, um, I'm not worried about it too much.","Right, OK. It hasn't been intense you said? So have you had headaches like this in the past?"
2963,"Yeah, I had similar headaches before I think. They come like this. Like if I didn't get a good sleep or from not drinking enough water or something, I'll kind of get a headache like this. Kind of feels like it's squeezing.","Yeah, that's understandable. But it's not like the worst headache you've ever had?"
2964,"No, no, it's pretty similar to headaches that I've had before.","OK, OK, good, and are you otherwise healthy?"
2965,"Yeah, well I have high blood pressure and also, high cholesterol, so I do take medications for both of those. So yeah, I take a statin and Amlodipine I think.","K, OK, good. It's good that you're on both of those. Do you take any other medications like over the counter medications or herbal supplements?"
2966,"Yeah, I've been taking vitamin D and also a multivitamin. I heard that that we don't get enough vitamin D throughout the winter.","Yeah, it's a great idea to take that, especially as we get older and if we live in a country where we don't get a lot of sun exposure like Canada, so that's good. And sorry before I move on, I forgot to ask you earlier if you have experienced any weight loss or night sweats recently?"
2967,"No, my weight's been, uh, about the same unfortunately and I haven't had any night sweats. But I mean now that you asked if I felt more hot than than usual, maybe.","OK, and did you take your temperature?"
2968,"Uh, I did and the last time I checked it was a few days ago and at that time I didn't have a fever, but I mean, I'm still feeling hot so I'm not sure.","Yeah, OK. Alright, so I'll go back to your past medical history. Have you been hospitalized or have you ever needed surgeries in the past?"
2969,"Um, no. Like the last time I was in the hospital with, it was for a colonoscopy a few years ago which came back normal.","OK, that's good. Um, are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
2970,"Uh, yeah, actually got the shingles vaccine a few months ago.",OK.
2971,"Probably closer to a year ago now, actually.","Oh great, OK, that's awesome and are you allergic to anything?"
2972,Just peanuts.,"Peanuts, OK. Do you know if you have a family history of any lung or heart conditions?"
2973,"Yeah, my son has asthma. But nobody in my family's had a heart problem, though.","OK, how about any stomach problems or liver problems? Colon problems?"
2974,"Yeah, my dad actually had colon cancer. He was 70 and so that's why we went and decided to get a colonoscopy instead of just doing the immunohistochemistry test.","OK, yeah, that's a good idea. Um, so it sounds like you're, you know, preemptive with your health, which is good. Any other cancers that run in the family?"
2975,"No, just my dad had colon cancer.",OK. And do you smoke at all?
2976,"No, I don't.","K, how about marijuana?"
2977,"Um, no, I don't smoke marijuana.","OK, how about other recreational drugs?"
2978,"I mean, I briefly like dabbled in the past at parties and stuff like that but that was when I was way younger, like in in my college years.","OK, what kind of drugs?"
2979,"I think maybe we used cocaine a few times and MDMA, uh, but that was like a long time, probably like 30 years ago.","OK, were any of these drugs injected IV?"
2980,"No, no, I've never done that.","OK, OK, that's good. Do you drink alcohol?"
2981,have like maybe I don't know a couple of drinks a week.,"OK, that's good. What kind of drinks do you have and how much of it do you have?"
2982,"Usually, it'll just be one or two glasses of wine at a time and maybe two nights a week.",OK.
2983,And I usually stick with red wine.,"OK, great, and who do you live with?"
2984,"So um, it's just me and my son.",How old is your son?
2985,"Uh, he's 18.","OK, and do you live in a house or an apartment?"
2986,"Um, yeah, we live in an apartment. Yeah, on the 8th floor.","On the 8th floor, OK, any issues in terms of like old carpet or mold or asbestos in the apartment?"
2987,"It's a newish building so there isn't really any carpet actually in the unit, so yeah, it's pretty clean that way.",OK good. That's good. So those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or concerns that you wanted to bring up before we ended the interview?
2988,"Well, I'm just hoping to to get this sorted out and feel better.","Yeah for sure. So you know, right now we're thinking it could be a viral GI viral infection because of your complaints of nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and fever. But it could also be COVID and we are going to have to do a swab for you and run that test because you have a lot of symptoms that overlap with those symptoms. Um, and then, so just going off of that, we'll wait for the swabs to come back. If they come back positive, we will notify public health and they'll do a trace to see where you could have gotten this infection from. And then meanwhile, we do suggest that you isolate for two weeks so that you don't spread the illness, and even if the swab comes back negative, there is still a chance that you may have COVID and it's a false negative test. So we'll start there. If it turns out you don't have any of those viral illnesses and you have more of a, you know, bacterial picture, we can work you up for that and prescribe antibiotics. So that's where we will start. How does that sound?"
2989,"Yeah, that sounds like a great start. Thank you.","Alright, great."
2990,"Well, I've had this cough but the biggest issue is that I've been really short of breath.","OK, um, when did the cough start?"
2991,I would say about 3 days ago.,"Three days ago, OK, and uh, around that time did you also start feeling short of breath?"
2992,"Uh, the shortness of breath has come on, I don't know within the last day or so. It's come on after that, the cough started first.","OK, and the cough, is it a dry cough or is it a wet cough?"
2993,"Well, I've been bringing up some yellowish green, kind of like phlegm, so um I guess a wet cough.","OK, so yeah, yellowish green you said."
2994,Yeah.,"OK, any blood in the sputum?"
2995,I haven't noticed any blood.,"OK, and how much sputum are you coughing up each time? Like is it kind of the size of your fingertip or does it fill your whole palm?"
2996,"Um, yeah, probably more like the size of like a thumb tip.","OK, OK um, and do you notice any, like pus or froth in the sputum?"
2997,Nothing like that I noticed.,"OK, and if you were to describe the sound of your cough, does it sound like it's barky or like a hacking cough?"
2998,"I don't know, I guess hacking.","Alright, and do you hear any wheezing at all?"
2999,"No, well, maybe I guess when I'm really short of breath, yeah, wheezing, yeah.","OK, and the shortness of breath, how severe is it? 1 to 10, 10 being the worst?"
3000,Maybe a 7?,"At seven OK, are you having issues sleeping because of your shortness of breath?"
3001,"Uh, well I can't tell if it's that or the cough. I mean between those two things it's been definitely interrupting my sleep.","OK, and do you find there are any triggers to your coughing like like um, a particular time of the day? Triggers like you know pollen or things in your environment like pets?"
3002,"No the cough has been kind of going on all day. Um, right when I get up in the morning and goes on all night, it's been getting worse to these last few days.","OK yeah, um yeah, that doesn't sound great in terms of your shortness of breath. Do you find that certain positions make it worse? Or like exerting yourself makes it worse?"
3003,"Um, not really.","OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?"
3004,"No, I haven't.",OK. And any other symptoms that you have along with your coughing and sputum?
3005,"As soon as I breath, well, I just haven't felt good like, tired, kind of weakish.","OK yeah um, along with your fatigue and feeling weak, have you experienced any dizziness or fainting spells?"
3006,No dizziness and I haven't fainted or anything like that.,"OK, any confusion or memory loss?"
3007,No concerns with my memory.,"OK. And how about um, muscle aches or any sort of body aches?"
3008,"Alright, yeah, maybe a bit, kind of, and weak.","Yeah, alright, so let's go back to your shortness of breath. Do you have any chest pain associated with that?"
3009,"Uh, no.","OK, and do you ever feel like your heart's racing?"
3010,"No, nothing like that.","OK, and how about changes to your bowel movements?"
3011,"No, those have been normal. I haven't had any diarrhea or constipation.",OK and no blood in your stool?
3012,"I haven't noticed any blood, no.","OK, how about abdominal pains?"
3013,"Oh yeah, I don't know why, yeah, my belly's been a bit achy maybe.","OK, and how about a sore throat?"
3014,"No, my throat felt OK.","OK, good and have you experienced any loss of taste?"
3015,"No loss of taste, but I've noticed, yeah, my smell has been kind of funny.","Your smell has been kind of funny, like you can't smell or do things smell differently than you expect them to?"
3016,"Yeah, there was a candle on earlier today and I guess I couldn't really smell it, so I guess I haven't been able to smell.","Ok, do you have a runny nose or a blocked nose?"
3017,"No, I haven't had to blow my nose or anything.","OK, any changes in your vision or hearing?"
3018,"No, that's been normal.","OK, any discharge or pain in your eyes or ears?"
3019,"No, that's been OK.","OK, and then any changes to your urine?"
3020,"No, I haven't had any pain or anything like that.","OK, and are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any medical conditions?"
3021,"Yeah, I have atrial fibrillation. And I do take Metoprolol for that.","OK, how long have you had A. fib?"
3022,"It was like 4 years ago I think it was. It was having that like, felt like my heart was racing you were asking about earlier and they did an ECG and I was told I had atrial fibrillation. So yeah, I've been on a beta blocker for three years now.","OK, four years, and when was the last time you had an ECG?"
3023,"Uh, maybe just a couple of months ago. I think every time that I come in to see my family doctor, they they do one.","OK, and the last time that it was done, was it normal?"
3024,"eah, they said yeah. My heart rate's been around 80 beats per minute which is good and I haven't had any symptoms so things have been stable.","OK, good. And then have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?"
3025,I had an inguinal hernia repair about 15 years ago.,"OK, any complications from that?"
3026,Um no.,"OK, and then besides the Metoprolol, are you on any other medications?"
3027,"Oh yeah, I take a statin and baby aspirin.","OK, and is that for the A. fib as well, the aspirin? Or is that just for other cardiovascular issues or some sort of preventative measure?"
3028,"Yeah, I heard it was good for people who have atrial fibrillation so I started taking it.",OK. and let's revisit your medications at the end of today's session. I just want to make sure that you're on the medications and I just want to make sure you're on the right dose.  Does that sound good?
3029,"Yeah, certainly.","K great. And ok, so we talked about your past medical history and medications. We will talk a little bit about any allergies that you have, if you have any."
3030,I think it's like a sulfa allergy. I received an antibiotic like that many years ago and had a rash.,"OK, OK and have you had any reason to suspect that you may have taken any sulfas recently?"
3031,"No, I haven't had any antibiotics so no, really no changes.","OK, OK, good and are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
3032,I am yeah. I've received the Zoster vaccine for shingles and also the one for pneumonia.,"OK, good, good yeah, those two we definitely recommend if you're over 65. OK, and do you know of any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?"
3033,"No, I think my aunt had lung cancer but she smoked her entire life.","OK, OK and how about other cancers?"
3034,No other cancers.,And have you been in touch or do you think you've been in contact with any anyone sick recently?
3035,"Well, I visited my mother at a long term care facility just this past weekend, so I guess about just over a week ago I visited there.","OK, and have there been any COVID outbreaks at the long term care?"
3036,"Yeah, there has been, I thought I was like away from those areas but I have heard about outbreaks there.","OK, OK and any travel history?"
3037,No travel.,And do you smoke?
3038,"I used to smoke a pack of cigarettes a day, but I quit about, uh, about five years ago. I know four years ago it was when I found out I had atrial fibrillation. I quit.","OK, OK, well that's good. Good for you for quitting. How about marijuana?"
3039,"No, I don't smoke it, but I'll use some edibles I buy from the Ontario stores a couple of times per week. Just the CBD stuff.",The CBD stuff OK. And how many milligrams?
3040,"I'm not sure, I know it's their lowest dose though.","OK, OK if it's lowest dose, it might be 2.5 milligrams."
3041,Sounds familiar.,OK good. Is there a particular reason you take these CBD edibles?
3042,It helps me sleep.,"OK, if it's specifically to help you sleep, we can actually try and see if there are other options for you. You know there are pills, like they are sleep aids. Or even things like melatonin that can help regulate your sleep so we can revisit other options for you if you're open to that as well."
3043,"OK for sure. Yeah I will. Um, yeah we can talk about that later.","OK, that sounds good and do you do any other recreational drugs?"
3044,I do not.,"OK, how about alcohol?"
3045,"Uh, no, I don't drink anymore.","OK, and did you used to drink before?"
3046,"Yes, I just stopped a few years ago,","OK, and what's your living situation like right now?"
3047,I live in a house with my wife.,"In a house, OK. Any concerns for like old carpets, mold or asbestos in your house?"
3048,"No, we've renovated it over the years.","OK, good and I apologize, but I would like to clarify three more symptoms with you. Did you say you felt like you had a fever earlier?"
3049,"Um, maybe I've been feeling a little hot, but it's been really more the cough and shortness of breath that's been bugging me.","OK, well we can take a temperature today just to make sure. Have you been feeling like you have night sweats or chills?"
3050,"Um, not really. No, I haven't noticed that.","OK, and how about, um, any weight loss over the past few months?"
3051,"No, it's been been stable.","OK, alright good, so that brings us to the end. Do you have any questions or concerns that you would like to clarify before we end the interview?"
3052,"No, nothing today.  I was just really hoping to get, uh, whatever this is sorted out.","Yeah, you know, um, right now it looks like, it sounds like it could be an upper respiratory viral illness, so that includes COVID.  So we will do a swab for you and then send it off to the lab for PCR results. In the meantime, because you have symptoms that overlap with COVID symptoms, we do encourage isolation for 14 days. Until your symptoms are gone, sorry,  until your symptoms are gone, even if they're gone, we do suggest isolating for 14 days just to make sure you're not a carrier or could spread COVID so we do encourage that, and that includes from your husband. If possible, we will get those results in a day or two. If they are positive, we will send your results to public health who will be in touch with you to do some contact tracing to see where you may have gotten it from. If it's not COVID, it could be other viral illnesses that are going around this time of year. And if your symptoms aren't getting better on their own, and there's reason to suspect you may have a bacterial infection or bacterial pneumonia, we will follow up with you and possibly prescribe antibiotics. How does that sound?"
3053,"Yeah, that sounds like a great plan.","OK, great so um, I will see you at the next appointment."
3054,"Yeah, so I've been feeling just really down recently in the last week. I started off by having this sore throat which started around 5 days ago and then I also noticed I've been getting some chills over the last few day. And on top of all of that, within the last three to four days I've been getting muscle aches all over my body.","OK, alright so the sore throat started 5 days ago and then the fever started when?"
3055,"So the fever. I think I haven't measured it, but I started having chills like 3 days ago.","Three days ago, OK, and the muscle aches started two days ago?"
3056,I would say 3 days ago as well.,"Three days ago, OK. OK, are you having any trouble swallowing foods or fluids?"
3057,"A little bit with solids with a sore throat but liquids, I'm doing OK right now.","OK. And is it hard for you to like, are you having issues vocalising at all?"
3058,"No, I think my voice has been the same. It's just when I'm not talking, especially if I'm swallowing my own like spit, it still hurts sometimes, but mainly with solid food.","OK, OK and then, are you having any issues with taste or smell?"
3059,"Uh, no, I don't think so.","OK, how about hearing or vision?"
3060,"No, no changes.",Any weight loss over the past few weeks?
3061,"No, I probably have gained weight.","OK, any fatigue or exhaustion?"
3062,"Now that you mention it, I do feel pretty tired over the last few days, I don't know if it's just because of my muscles aching all the time, or I don't know. I have definitely felt very tired.","OK, how about changes in your hair, nails or skin like rashes?"
3063,"No, nothing like that.",Do you have a cough at all?
3064,"No, I haven't really noticed the cough.",How about shortness of breath or wheezing?
3065,"No, no shortness of breath or wheezing.",OK chest pain or you feeling like your heart's racing?
3066,No.,"No, and how about dizziness or fainting spells?"
3067,"Uh, no, I haven't had any of those.","OK, how about changes to your bowel movements?"
3068,"No, I don't think so. I go regularly once a day and I haven't noticed any watery stool or diarrhea.","OK, that's good. Any changes in your appetite?"
3069,"Yeah, with a sore throat I tend to like eat softer foods right now. I can't really, I don't really feel like eating.","Yeah, OK. How about nausea or vomiting?"
3070,"No, no, nothing like that.","OK, OK, and any issues with joint pain? You said your muscle aches, but how about joints?"
3071,"Um, no, I don't think it's specifically my joints. I think more so I would say like around in my thighs. Then I would say just my upper arms hurt a lot. And even, uh, my upper back area hurts a lot as well, so it's kind of just everywhere. But those are some areas that hurt the most.","OK, OK, are you otherwise healthy?"
3072,"Um, yeah, I do have a couple of things on my list. I do have high blood pressure. I have diabetes and other than that, I also have like high cholesterol.",OK.
3073,"Yeah, that's just some of the things that I've been diagnosed with.","Yeah, OK, and do you take medication for any of these things?"
3074,"Yeah, so I take for the blood pressure, I take this medication called the Ramipril.",OK yeah.
3075,"And then for diabetes I'm taking Metformin. And then for the cholesterol I'm taking this medication called Crestor, yeah. Yeah, but other than that, just like vitamin D and multi vitamins. Those are some of the medications that I'm taking.","Sure yeah, are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
3076,Yup.,"OK, do you know if you got a vaccine called Shingrix for shingles and Pneumovax for pneumococcal infections?"
3077,"Yeah, I actually think I got them just this past season. Uh, with all this COVID going on, I just wanted to make sure I got all those vaccines as well. So yeah, I recently just got them.","OK, good. And and how about any allergies?"
3078,"Uh, no, I don't have any allergies.","OK, how about family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?"
3079,"Uhm, no lung conditions and uhh heart conditions, both my mom and dad suffered from like high blood pressure. My dad also had a heart attack when in his 60s. Now there is some heart conditions that run in the family.","OK, OK. And then any cancers in the family?"
3080,"Uhm, m son actually got diagnosed with colorectal cancer just a few years ago.","Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
3081,He's doing OK though. Like it was pretty scary at the time.,How old was he when he was diagnosed?
3082,"I think he was, yeah in his forties, 46.","OK, well he's yeah, that's young. Have you had a colonoscopy?"
3083,"Yeah I had it done. Everything came back normal so yeah, I'm not sure where he got it from.",OK. Have you had any sick contacts recently?
3084,"No, no sick contacts that I know of. I've been mainly in my house. I do go outside for groceries and some things like that, but other than that I'm retired. I don't really go out too much.","Yeah, OK, and you said you're retired. Do you live alone? Do you live with anyone?"
3085,"No, yeah, I live alone now. And I live in London in an apartment","OK, any old carpets? Mold, dust, asbestos?"
3086,"No, nothing like that. It's a pretty safe building.","OK, good, and do you smoke?"
3087,"I used to. I used to smoke, probably in my 20s to late 40s, but then I quit.","OK, good, good for you. How much did you smoke before you quit?"
3088,"Probably one to two packs a day, I would say.","OK, that's good, that's good that you quit. Do you drink any alcohol?"
3089,"Uhm, I just stick to some red wine, maybe a couple times a week.","OK, couple times a week so two to three times?"
3090,"Yeah, I would say two to three times and, uh, I probably go through maybe 1 bottle every two weeks.","OK, OK. And then any marijuana?"
3091,"No, no, I've never had any marijuana or any recreational drugs, no, nothing else.","OK, good, well those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own for me?"
3092,"Yeah, uh, with all this COVID and the pandemic going on, I don't know, I like, I've been mainly at my house, but like I said I do go to do my own groceries. Of course I wear a mask, but I don't know if I might have caught COVID,  so that's something I was worried about.","Yeah, for sure. I think just because your symptoms do overlap with those of COVID, we will be doing a COVID swab today and you should hear back about your results in 24 to 48 hours. But you should still self-isolate for 14 days because you do have similar symptoms and if it's not COVID, it's probably another viral illness that's going around these days and for that you don't need any medication, like prescribed medications, but just keep an eye on that, on your symptoms. Stay hydrated, eat well. If you need to lower your feve, you can use Tylenol. And if your symptoms worsen or you start getting neurological symptoms like weakness or seizures or anything like that, you should seek help from the ER. How does that sound?"
3093,"Sounds good. I just had another quick question. I did get the shingles and the pneumococcal vaccine back then but I didn't get the flu vaccine, like should I get it? Is it recommended?","Yes, it's definitely recommended. So we won't give you the vaccine right now because you have symptoms. But once you are healthy again, you should definitely get the get the flu vaccine and you should get it once a year."
3094,"OK, I just never took those vaccines, but I'll do that from now on.","Yeah, it's a good idea, and even if you get the flu, your symptoms won't be as severe if you have the vaccine, so it's definitely something to consider."
3095,"OK, alright sounds good.","Alright, take care."
3096,My child has been having a sore throat and chills yesterday as well.,"OK, so you mentioned the sore throat started three to four days ago and the chills started yesterday. And is he having any issues swallowing food or fluids?"
3097,"Yeah, it seems like appetite's gone down, like a lot of pain in his throat, especially when swallowing solid foods.","Have you taken a look into his throat? Is it red? Do you see any yellow streaking white stuff, anything like that?"
3098,"I definitely did take a look yesterday and definitely saw a lot of redness. I don't know if I saw any white or yellow streaks, but definitely looks very red in there.","OK, do his tonsils look enlarged?"
3099,"Uh, everything looks swollen in there, I don't know what's what, but it does look very angry in there.","OK, OK. And has he had a stuffy nose or runny nose?"
3100,"No, not really, no.",Any loss of taste or smell?
3101,"No, nothing like that.","OK, how about changes in vision or hearing? Any changes in her nails or skin like rashes?"
3102,"No, no rashes.",OK. Have you taken his temperature at home?
3103,"No, I think he might have had a fever yesterday, but we didn't really take a temperature.","OK. And, any fatigue or exhaustion?"
3104,"Energy's pretty much the same, just really complaining a lot about the throat.","OK, OK, have you noticed any swelling in in the neck area?"
3105,"Uhm, I think there might be like a few lumps near his neck, so I don't know if that's swelling, but definitely there is. There's a few that I felt over the last few days.","OK, coughing?"
3106,"No, hasn't been coughing at all","OK, um, and how about shortness of breath or wheezing?"
3107,"No, nothing like that.",Chest pain?
3108,No.,Feeling like his heart is racing?
3109,No.,Swelling in his limbs?
3110,No. I haven't noticed anything like that.,"OK, dizziness or fainting spells?"
3111,No.,Headaches?
3112,"He was complaining of a headache a few days ago, but it kind of went away on its own.",OK. So the headache's gone completely now.
3113,"Yeah, yeah.",OK. Have any confusion or memory loss?
3114,"No, not that I know.",Joint pain or muscle aches?
3115,No.,"OK, how about his bowel movements? Have those been normal?"
3116,"No, no, he hasn't told me anything about that.",Any appetite changes?
3117,"Yeah, just with the trouble swallowing I'm trying to make sure that he gets like liquids because over the last few days he can't tolerate like solid foods at all.","Yeah, how about a weight loss over the past few weeks?"
3118,"No, not really. t's just been over the last few days that he hasn't been eating like himself.",OK. Alright and has he been healthy otherwise?
3119,"Yeah, otherwise he's a very healthy child. We have rarely gone to a doctor for him before, so yeah, nothing. Nothing else with him.","OK, have you tried anything for his sore throat? Anything over the counter?"
3120,"We did try, uh, like Tylenol cold. It helped with this headache, but it didn't really help with his sore throat","OK, and has he ever experienced anything like this in the past?"
3121,"No, not that I know of.",OK. Any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?
3122,No.,Any medications that he's on?
3123,"No, no medication.","OK, is he up to date with all his immunizations?"
3124,"Yeah, all his immunizations are up to date.","OK, any allergies?"
3125,"No, not that I know.","OK, family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?"
3126,"No, no lung or heart conditions. His father does have diabetes though.","OK, how old was he when he was diagnosed with diabetes?"
3127,I think probably in his late 30s with type 2 diabetes.,"Type 2, OK and then any sick contacts recently that he may have had?"
3128,"I don't think at home at least, uh, but maybe at school, like you never know who they are in contact with, so I'm wondering if he just picked it up somewhere from school.",OK.
3129,"Yeah, yeah, they're all wearing masks right now, but I don't know if he picked something something up from his classmates.","Yeah for sure. OK, and then any travel to anywhere recently?"
3130,"No, we've been at home, haven't left even to go to like a different city, have been in London the whole time.","OK, yeah, and who does he live with at home?"
3131,So he lives with myself and his dad.,Any siblings?
3132,"No, he's an only child.","OK, any reason to believe you have old carpets, mold, asbestos, anything that could be triggering his symptoms?"
3133,"You know we don't have any pets. We don't have any like old carpets, it's a fairly new apartment, so I don't think any of that should be an issue.","Okay, well, I think those are all the questions that I had for him. Anything that you wanted to add or anything that I missed today?"
3134,"Uh, no, I think those are everything I wanted to talk about but I just was wondering if he needs to get tested or like if there's anything we can do today for him.","Yeah, so he does seem to be checking off some of the criteria for strep throat. So just to make sure, because he does have a score of right now at least three or four, or maybe even five, definitely over four, we can prescribe him some antibiotics. But we will do a rapid strep test first in the clinic here today just to rule out in or rule that out. If it comes back positive and I guess even if it isn't positive because he checked off a lot of the boxes for strep throat, we will give him a prescription for penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days. And then you can take that if his symptoms don't go away in a day or two. Because his symptoms also overlap with COVID, we will. do a swab for that as well and you should hear back within 24 to 48 hours and then you should isolate for 14 days. Does that sound good?"
3135,"Yeah, that sounds good.","OK, great thank you."
3136,"Yeah, I've had this sore throat for the past three days and it doesn't seem to be getting any better at all. I feel sort of feverish so. I just thought I should come in and get this checked out.","OK, and when did you start having this sore throat?"
3137,Three days ago.,"OK, and how about the fever?"
3138,The fever I noticed maybe a day back.,"OK, and did you get any temperature measurements?"
3139,"I didn't take any myself. But I felt hot, and I felt chills.","OK, and have your sore throat or fever gone worse at all?"
3140,"I think it's getting worse, yeah.","And does it usually happen during the day, throughout the night or does it have any sort of pattern?"
3141,"I would say that it doesn't really have a pattern. The sore throat is always there and the fever started a day back and it seems to break sometimes, but right now there is no real pattern to it.","OK. And besides that, do you have any cough?"
3142,"No, no cough.","OK, and have you tried anything that has helped you at all?"
3143,"I tried just like those Lozenges and seems to be helping just soothe my throat, but it's a temporary relief.",OK. And have you had anything like this happen to you before?
3144,"No, nothing like this.",And is the sore throat constant? Or does it come and go?
3145,I would say it's pretty constant now.,OK. And have you been around anyone that has been sick recently?
3146,Not that I know of.,Anything that makes your sore throat worse?
3147,"I guess swallowing foods makes it worse, or at least it's painful.","OK. And have you at all noticed any like swelling around your neck region, like swelling of your lymph nodes?"
3148,"So yeah, not swelling of my entire neck, but I have felt some lumps in my neck.","OK, and how about any swelling anywhere else on your body?"
3149,Nowhere else.,"OK, have you noticed any kind of skin changes like rashes or anything like that?"
3150,No.,OK. And have you traveled at all recently?
3151,"No, nowhere.","OK, do you have any headaches or nausea or vomiting?"
3152,"No, nothing like that.","OK, and any night sweats."
3153,No.,And do you feel fatigued like increased tiredness at all?
3154,"Umm, yeah, I've been feeling really tired.","OK, any chest pain or feeling that your heart is racing?"
3155,"No, nothing like that.","OK. Any issues with bowel movements, like any diarrhea or constipation?"
3156,"No, no changes.",Have you been getting sleep at night or do you have to keep waking up?
3157,"Um, I've been getting OK, I sleep like, I've been sleeping about 7 to 8 hours.",OK. And how about your appetite?
3158,"I would say that's been OK as well, it's just hard to eat a lot of food because of this sore throat.",And is it just with solids or do you get the soreness with liquids too?
3159,"I would say mostly with solids, sometimes with liquid. If it's like really cold or something.","OK. Do you have any kind of allergies to anything in your house like carpets, pets or anything like that?"
3160,No.,"OK, have you had any recent infections like a cold?"
3161,No.,"No, OK. And do you have any past medical conditions?"
3162,"Um, I have Crohn's disease.",And when did you get diagnosed with Crohn's?
3163,That would have been last year.,"Last year, OK. And are you taking any medications for your Crohn's disease?"
3164,"I am on something for it, I think it's Sulfasalazine or something like that.",OK. And any other medications besides that?
3165,"Uhm, no, I don't think so.",Any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?
3166,"Um, I had a colonoscopy done. I just needed hospitalization for just the day I guess.","OK, and when was that?"
3167,That was also last year.,"Last year, OK. And do you have any family history of any conditions that run in the family? Like do you have any Crohn's disease or Ulcerative Colitis that run in the family?"
3168,"Yeah, both do.","Both do, OK. Any anything else that runs in the family?"
3169,"Uhm, I know there's some asthma and eczema that run in the family too.",OK. And you mentioned you haven't been around anyone that was sick or recently got sick?
3170,No.,OK. And where do you currently live?
3171,"I live in an apartment by myself. Sorry, not by myself, with my parents and my younger brother.",And do you at all drink alcohol?
3172,"No, I drank once or twice in the past, but I didn't like it. It makes my Crohn's worse so I stay away from it.","OK, and do you smoke cigarettes?"
3173,No.,And how about any other drugs like marijuana?
3174,No.,"OK. Alright, so do you partake in any like sports or activities or anything like that?"
3175,"Um, I swim.","OK, any contact sports?"
3176,No.,"OK. Alright, so yeah, overall it seems that you had this sore throat which is constant, getting worse and a bit of a fever in th last one or two days and you've also had swelling in your neck and so yeah, do you have any other questions or concerns?"
3177,"No, like what do you think I have? Do you think it's COVID?","Yeah, so definitely at this time, you know whenever people have any respiratory symptoms we always want to rule out COVID.  So will definitely get a swab for COVID testing done for you today which should come back within 24 to 48 hours and in the meantime you should self isolate. And other than that, it can also be, due to this swelling in your lymph nodes and also just the other symptoms, it can be other viral infections. It can be mono so we definitely have to do a couple of tests, and there's one test that will do for mono as well which is called EBV antibody testing. So we'll do a couple of these tests today and then see what what comes back. And in the meantime you should definitely self isolate if you haven't been doing so already."
3178,"OK, sure I can do that.","Yeah, do you have any questions?"
3179,"No, that sounds good. Thank you so much.",You're welcome. Take care.
3180,"Well, I thought I should start by saying I was recently hospitalised for pneumonia. I left five days ago, but as soon as I left that evening, I started coughing again and now I have all the same symptoms. I have a cough, I'm feeling short of breath and I have a feeling like I have a fever.","OK, and before you were discharged the day, can you let me know what you had and what kind of things were you treated with?"
3181,"I was treated with some antibiotics, I don't know exactly which ones. They said I had some sort of bacterial pneumonia.",OK. But then it got resolved and they sent you home?
3182,"Yeah, that's right.",So are your symptoms similar to when you got admitted?
3183,"They are similar, but I feel like they are also worse now.","OK, worse, OK, so you're having a cough, shortness of breath and fever, and did that all start together? Or did one come before another?"
3184,"Um, so the cough came first, then the shortness of breath, and then the fever.","OK, and the cough, how would you describe the cough?"
3185,"Um, it's harsh, it's persistent.",Are you producing any sputum?
3186,"Um, I guess a little bit, yeah. Yeah, I guess a little bit and it's yellow.","It's yellow, OK, do you notice any kind of blood in your sputum?"
3187,"No, no blood.","OK, so just yellow sputum and how much would you say you're producing an average day?"
3188,"Um, maybe like, 10 to 15 times in a day I produce enough to fill like the inside of my palm.","OK. And with the fever, did you get a chance to measure, take a temperature at all?"
3189,"Umm, no, I haven't actually taken my temperature.","OK, but you've been having chills and are you having any other symptoms?"
3190,"Yeah, chills. I've been feeling kind of hot during the day.","Yeah, OK. And how about the shortness of breath, is that just during activity or you can have that when you're sleeping or resting as well?"
3191,The shortness of breath is more with like activity when I'm walking around.,OK. And have all these symptoms been getting worse at all?
3192,"Yeah, I'd say they're getting worse now. It's like this everyday and it's definitely getting worse.","OK, do you feel dizzy or lightheaded at all?"
3193,"Um, no.",Do you have any muscle aches?
3194,"Um, a little bit.","OK, and where on your muscles would you say are aching?"
3195,"I would say my lower limbs and just generally all over, but just yeah like the big muscles like my thighs, my shoulders.",OK. And have you been having any kind of swelling in your limbs at all?
3196,"No, no swelling.",OK and any kind of swelling of your neck region or lymph nodes?
3197,"No, not that I noticed.",OK. And do you feel any kind of chest pain with shortness of breath?
3198,"Um, no nothing like that.","OK, and since you've been out of the hospital, have you been in contact with anyone who's sick?"
3199,"No, I went straight home.",And any recent travel?
3200,"No, no recent travel.","OK, any headaches?"
3201,No headaches.,Any nausea or vomiting?
3202,No.,Any kind of fatigue or increased tiredness?
3203,"I feel fatigued, yes.","OK, and do you feel at all that your heart is racing?"
3204,No.,"OK, and do you have any symptoms like a loss of taste, sense of taste or smell?"
3205,No.,"So, OK, any kind of bowel movement issues? Any constipation or diarrhea?"
3206,No.,And any urinary trouble?
3207,"Um, nothing like that.","OK, have you lost any weight recently?"
3208,No.,Have you been able to sleep throughout the night or does the cough  wake you up or the chills wake you up?
3209,"Um, no,  they don't wake me up. I wouldn't say that.","OK. Are you having any other symptoms like a sore throat, runny nose, congestion, anything like that?"
3210,No.,"OK, and anything in your house like dust or an old carpet or pets? Anything that triggers some of these symptoms?"
3211,No.,"OK. OK, and in terms of your past medical history, any conditions that you've been diagnosed with like asthma, COPD, anything like that?"
3212,"Um, no, nothing like that.","OK, do you take any medications?"
3213,"I do, I take some multivitamins particularly calcium and vitamin D, and I'm also on Synthroid.","OK, so do you have hyperthyroidism?"
3214,"Yeah, sorry I forgot to mention that.","No worries. Then when you went home and you were discharged, did they give you any antibiotics to finish at home?"
3215,"Ah yes, they did. So I only had one days worth left. I was switched from IV antibiotic  to the oral kind and so I'd finish the remaining pills that day, then went home.","OK, so you finished the course, OK. Great and do you have any past history when you were admitted, any other hospitalizations or surgeries at all?"
3216,"Um, no.","Do you have any family history of asthma, COPD or any lung conditions?"
3217,No.,Any other conditions that run in the family?
3218,No.,"OK. And currently, where do you live?"
3219,I live in a house with my daughter and her husband.,"OK, and any one of them have similar symptoms or have been sick recently?"
3220,No.,"OK, and have you had a COVID test done at all?"
3221,"Um, no, no COVID tests have been done. I had one in the hospital before I was admitted, but none today.",OK. And do you smoke at all?
3222,I used to smoke. I don't smoke anymore.,"OK, and when did you quit?"
3223,About seven years ago.,OK congratulations.
3224,Yeah.,"And how much would you say you smoked before that, and for how many years?"
3225,"Before that, I would say it's like gosh, 20 years and then about a pack a day.",OK. Do you drink alcohol?
3226,I drink like a glass of wine a week.,OK. Any other recreational drugs like marijuana?
3227,No.,"OK. Yeah, so is there anything else? Any other questions that you have for me today?"
3228,"No, what do you think I have?","Yeah, so there's definitely multiple things that can be going on. Since you were just recently admitted, maybe you might have another bacterial r espiratory infection, like a pneumonia or it could be viral as well. So the first thing we want to do is for sure get COVID swab done and then we will also get, since you were admitted, as well recently, we want to get an X Ray on you just to see if there's any pneumonia. OK, and so we'll be keeping you here for a bit until everything comes back. We'll get some blood work done for you as well to see if there's any infection in your body. And then yeah, so just sit tight, we'll get all those things done. Is that OK with you?"
3229,"Yeah, that's great. Thank you.","You're welcome, yeah. So well will be updating you shortly."
3230,"Yeah I have my 2 year old daughter here with me. I don't know what's happening with her, but she seems to be getting really sick. So I'll give you that kind of timeline. So two days ago she was feeling hot and her fever hasn't broken. We've been giving her Tylenol, but she still seems to have a fever. The last time I checked her temperature was 38.5 and she seems to have issues swallowing food. She's drooling and she seems short of breath.","OK, and when did she start getting short of breath?"
3231,That started yesterday.,Has her fever been getting worse or has it stayed around the same?
3232,"So I just checked the first day. It was like 38, 38.5.","OK, and when did the trouble swallowing start?"
3233,That started yesterday as well.,"OK, and has it been getting worse at all?"
3234,I think so. Now she's barely even drinking fluids.,"OK, so it's both solids and fluids. OK, have you noticed any swelling in her neck area or redness or swelling in her throat?"
3235,"Yeah, I've noticed some of that.","OK, you see a lot of redness in there?"
3236,"I see, yeah, I see quite a bit of redness in there.",And has she been drooling at all?
3237,"Yeah, a little bit today.","OK. Alright, any coughing?"
3238,Not hat I noticed.,"No coughing. OK, and do you notice that she's increasingly fatigued, or just not herself? Or is she irritable?"
3239,"Yeah, she's very irritable.","OK, do you notice any kind of paleness or blueness in her skin? Anything like that?"
3240,She's not blue. She's looking a little pale though.,"OK, and sorry, when did the shortness of breath start? Is it getting worse at all?"
3241,"Shortness of breath started yesterday as well, moreso today which is why I brought her in.","OK, any other symptoms like nausea or vomiting or diarrhea or constipation?"
3242,"Um, no nothing like that.","OK, and how's her appetite and sleep?"
3243,"It's been, it's been not great. She's not eating well, I guess because she's in a lo of pain and she didn't sleep well for the past two nights either.","OK uhm, has she had any recent infections at all, like a cold or anything like that?"
3244,"She did have a cough 2 weeks ago, yeah.","OK, and did it just go away on it's own or did she need any antibiotics or any other medications?"
3245,"I think no, she didn't need any antibiotics. It kind of went away on its own.","OK, any sick contacts within the last week or two weeks?"
3246,"I mean, she goes to daycare so she might have picked something up from there. Yeah, last I checked, no one at daycare was sick like right now. But three weeks ago there was someone who was sick.","OK, any past medical history?"
3247,"Um, no, she's been pretty healthy otherwis.",Any issues during pregnancy or after birth at all?
3248,No.,Are her immunizations are up to date?
3249,"Um, yes, she didn't get the H. flu vaccine though.","OK, OK, any hospitalizations or anything like that in the past?"
3250,"Um, no.","OK, and any family history of any medical conditions?"
3251,"Um, no.","And currently, who does she live with at home?"
3252,I'm she lives with myself as well as her older brother.,"OK, alright, so yeah those are all the questions that I have."
3253,Do you think this is like an urgent matter?,"Because she has not been vaccinated with the H.flu vaccine and some of the symptoms that she's displaying like the drooling and trouble swallowing and now especially the shortness of breath are very concerning, I really think we should go to the Emergency Department. I'll give them a call to le them know that you're coming. Yeah, and what they will most likely do there is get a test done to see if she has H. flu and also they might do perhaps like a COVID swab as well. They might get an X Ray of her neck as well to see it. So what I think might be going on is with H. flu you can get swelling of your epiglottis and it can kind of obstruct your throat. It's very urgent matter, so that's why we will make sure you get to the ER and, uh, you know, we'll go from there. Does that sound? I know it may be very worrying right now. Do you have any questions at all?"
3254,"Yeah, do you know how long will she have to be in the hospital?","So right now we just need to make sure that she's stable, like all her vitals. You know when she gets to the ER, they can give her the appropriate antibiotics as well. And based on that, we need to make sure her breathing get stabilized, so she might be in the ER for one day. If they think she needs to be on IV antibiotics in the hospital, she might be in the hospital for a few more days or even a week. So it's really hard to say right now, but our priority right now is to make sure she's stabilized in the ER."
3255,"OK. OK yeah, that sounds good.","So I'll give them a call right now, and, uh, you can head over to the ER. Or if you need a ride, we can arrange to do that for you too."
3256,"OK, great, that sounds great.",Thank you.
3257,So I've had this stuffy nose for the past three days. I'm getting some yellow discharge from the nose. I can't seem to smell well. And I have had this terrible headache for the past two days as well.,"OK, so just to kind of get a timeline, what kind of started first?"
3258,"So first, my nose was kind of stuffy. And and then I started having this yellow discharge from the nose and then I kind of lost some of my smell. And then now my head hurts. It's not even like, it's not like a headache, it's like a facial pressure",OK. And have you had any of these symptoms before?
3259,"No, never.","OK. Alright, have you noticed...so you said like the discharge is yellow, how much of the discharge are you having like in a day?"
3260,Like probably enough to fill the inside of my palm.,"OK, and have you been having any fevers or chills?"
3261,"Uh, no,  nothing like that. I did have what they thought was a viral infection a week back.","OK. And did you recover from it, like on your own?"
3262,"Yeah, it went away on its own.","OK, so it was just, you just had some cold-like symptoms?"
3263,"Yeah, that's right.","OK, alright, have you been coughing at all?"
3264,"Uh, no.","OK, any sore throat?"
3265,No.,Any trouble breathing?
3266,No.,Any loss of sense of taste or smell?
3267,I guess loss of smell.,"OK, and did that come after the congestion or was it present before?"
3268,The loss of smell came after the congestion.,"OK, and would you say you're still pretty congested?"
3269,"I think so, yeah.",OK. And has it been getting worse would you say? Or do you feel that it's getting better?
3270,"Um, I would say it's getting worse.","OK, and right now what would you say is the most troubling symptom for you? Is it that pressure in your face or is it the congestion?"
3271,It's the...it's the pressure in my face. It hurts.,"Yeah, have you tried any medications, over the counter medications at all?"
3272,I tried some nasal sprays. And like decongestions but it's not really helping.,"OK. And so you've tried nasal sprays? Have you tried any of those, like nasal rinses, or anything like that?"
3273,"Yeah, and they don't seem to be helping.","I see, OK. Any recent contact with anyone who's been ill or any recent travel?"
3274,"Uh, no.","OK, any nausea or vomiting?"
3275,"Uh, no.",Any fevers or chills?
3276,No.,Any fatigue?
3277,"Yeah, I've been feeling tired.","OK, and how many days would you say you've been feeling tired for?"
3278,"Uh, I would say for the past three days?","OK, and do you feel that, you know you're having some discharge, but do you feel that there is mucous building up and dripping down your throat or anything like that?"
3279,"Yeah, now that you mention it, it does feel like that.","OK, and have you noticed at all or has someone told you that your breath might smell bad? Or have you noticed it yourself?"
3280,"Oh gosh, I hope not, no. No one said that.","OK yeah, sometimes with like mucous buildup it can affect like your breath as well. So yeah, just wondering. Any chest pain at all?"
3281,"No, no chest pain.",Constipation or diarrhea?
3282,No.,Any issues with urinating?
3283,"No, no issues there.",Any changes in your sleep or appetite?
3284,"Well, I guess sleeping is a little bit harder now because of the pressure in my face, but other than that, no.","OK, is there anything that helps you at all that you've tried?"
3285,"Like just the positions of how I'm sleeping sometimes helps, yeah.","OK, so this has been going on for, just remind me again, like the last four day?"
3286,"Yeah, the last three days, last three days.",OK. Do you have any other medical conditions at all that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
3287,"No, not that I can think of.","OK. Alright, so have you noticed at all any weight changes?"
3288,No.,"OK, and have you been exposed to like fumes or dust? Or how do you have any animals or pets at home?"
3289,"No, nothing like that.","OK, and do you take any medications or anything regularly?"
3290,"Um no, I just take some multivitamins.","OK, and do you know if you have any allergies?"
3291,"I just have some, I just have some seasonal allergies.","OK, any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?"
3292,"Uh, no, actually I had my appendix taken out when I was 12.","OK. Right, and do you have any family history of any conditions, like any lung conditions, heart conditions, any cancers?"
3293,"Um, I know that there's some asthma that runs in the family.","OK, and have you ever been diagnosed with asthma?"
3294,I live in a house with my husband and my 3 year old daughter.,OK. And do you currently smoke cigarettes?
3295,No.,Do you drink alcohol?
3296,I don't.,Any recreational drugs like marijuana?
3297,"Um, I'll smoke a joint or two once a week.","Ok, a joint or two, OK. And is that, is that just recreationally or has it been helping at all with your symptoms?"
3298,"Uh, that's just recreationally.","OK. Alright, yeah, so those are all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all for me?"
3299,"Uh, no, what was like, what do you think I have?","Yeah, so from the symptoms that you're describing, it does seem more like sinus issues. There's a sinus behind your face and what can happen is if you get an infection, like all the the mucous and everything can build up and increase the pressure. That's the pressure you're feeling underneath your face.  It's because of a sinus infection most likely. And usually like, it's usually like a viral infection that can go away on its own. We usually ask patients to try the nasal rinses, and then some oral decongestents. Or have you tried any anti histamines?"
3300,"No, I haven't.","OK, so no antihistamines. It seems most likely that you have a sinus infection. It can be bacterial with the yellow discharge that you're having as well. So we can give you some antibiotics, so will give you some. Amoxicillin."
3301,Sure.,"So it's only been three day since you're having these symptoms, right?  And you haven't had any high fever or anything like that? Have you measured your temperature?"
3302,"I haven't, I haven't, no.",OK.
3303,I don't feel hot though.,"OK, since it's been three days, what I'm going to do is still give you some antibiotics so Amoxicillin and then we'll see like after you finish that dose how you feel. And will set up another appointment for when we can do like a phone appointment and or clinic appointment when your doses are done. Does that sound good?"
3304,Yeah that sounds great. Thank you.,"OK, you're welcome and hopefully you feel better."
3305,Thank you.,Take care.
3306,"Yeah, absolutely. Uhm, I don't know, I've just been feeling a little feverish, uhm, and I also have a, a bit of a sore throat.","OK, when..."
3307,"I just came in, I just came in to see what's going on, cause I was worried, you know, with covid going on, uhm, going everywhere.","Certainly, when did the, the sore throat start?"
3308,Last night actually.,OK.
3309,Yeah.,"And uhm, have you had any, uhm, problems with swallowing, like food or liquids?"
3310,"No, I don't think so. I just had breakfast this morning and no problems there.","OK, uh, any like, changes that, uhm, other symptoms that you've been having with the sore throat?"
3311,"Yeah, I'm just feeling a little feverish.","OK, and when did that start?"
3312,This morning.,"OK, did you take your temperature?"
3313,"No, I don't have a thermometer at home.","OK, and have you had any, any cough?"
3314,No.,"OK, how about any, like red eyes or runny nose?"
3315,"No, neither of those.","OK, have you had a headache?"
3316,No.,"OK, uh, and have you had any shortness of breath?"
3317,I don't think so.,"OK, and how about any loss of taste or loss of smell?"
3318,"Yeah, I don't, uh, yes, I said I was eating breakfast this morning, but it just tasted really bland.","OK, so maybe loss of taste, so you feel like your nose is really or that you're really congested?"
3319,"I guess yeah, now that I think about it.","OK, uh, and how has your appetite been?"
3320,It's alright.,"OK, and so you haven't had any cough or shortness of breath, but have you noticed any wheezing?"
3321,No.,OK. And have you had any chest pain?
3322,No.,"Have you felt as though your hearts's been racing at all or, or beating out of your chest?"

3328,No.,"Alright, and then how about any muscle aches or, or body aches?"
3329,"Sort of, like I just, I found it really hard to get out of bed this morning.","OK. How has your energy been? Have you been, like really fatigued?"
3330,Yeah.,"OK, and when did, uh, you said the muscle ache started this morning, uhm, how, when did the fatigue start?"
3331,"I'd say this morning as well, yesterday was just like a little tickle in my throat and I thought it would just go away you know, and I woke up this morning and I just felt horrible. And the sore throat was just worse and I felt feverish and tired and I felt really crappy.","OK, yeah, and have you had any symptoms like this before?"
3332,"Well yeah, I usually get a cold once a year in the fall. It does feel similar to that.",OK.
3333,"But I still wanted to be careful and come in, just in case.","yeah, certainly. Have you had, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?"
3334,I have migraines.,"OK, and are you taking any medications regularly?"

3336,"Uh, nope.",OK. And do you smoke cigarettes?
3337,"I smoke, uh, two or three a day.","OK, and have you tried to quit?"
3338,No.,"OK, if at any point this is something that you wanted to talk about, we, we certainly could later."
3339,sure.,Do you drink alcohol?
3340,"Uhm, a glass at night with dinner.","OK, and do you use any other recreational drugs?"
3341,"No, no, no, nothing like that.","OK, have you in the past?"
3342,No.,"OK, and have you been around anybody who's been sick recently?"
3343,"Uhm, oh, my, like my little granddaughter had, uhm, you know, they're always having a runny nose, right, the little ones.",Mhm.
3344,"But no, nothing, nothing else. I've just been at home for the most part.","OK, have you traveled traveled anywhere?"
3345,No.,"OK, and, uh, does your granddaughter go to daycare? Or is she in school?"

3350,Diabetes.,"Diabetes, OK. And who had diabetes?"
3351,"Lets see, my mom, my sister, my brother, yeah, yeah.","OK. And just to, get to know you a little bit better as well. I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation?"
3352,"Sure, yeah, I live with uh, I live with my son and daughter and my grandson.","OK, uhm, and, uhm, OK, yeah, I think that's all I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything else that you wanted to tell me or maybe that I forgot to ask about?"
3353,"Uh no, I don't think so. Do you think I have covid?","It's, it's certainly possible. It will be something we test for."
3354,Sure.,"Although the symptoms that you're experiencing, with feeling or having a fever, sore throat, and not feeling well with the muscle aches and fatigue, uhm, its relatively non-specific, so as you mentioned, it could be something like the common cold, that you've experienced in the past, so we can't rule that out either at this time, but we will do some investigations including a nasal swab for covid and kind of go from there."
3355,"OK, sounds good.","All right, we'll get that started."
3356,"Yeah absolutely. I have had this awful, awful headache for the past, two days I wanna say, its horrible.","OK, has the headache, uhm, stayed the same, gotten worse, gotten any better?"

3360,"I've been feeling really tired. I took the day off yesterday and today, I'm working from home, but I still decided not to get any work done today or yesterday.","OK. Uhm, and the fatigue, when did that start?"
3361,I think that started yesterday morning.,"OK. And sorry, back to the headache. Have you tried anything for it?"

3363,"Sure, yeah, so it's like right in the front. Just kind of feels like a band, just like this pressure in the front of my head.","OK, and has there been anything that's made the headache worse, like lights or, or sounds?"
3364,"No, no, like I said it's like nothing like my usual migraine headaches.","OK. And, I mean, the Advil or Tylenol, It helps the symptoms for a brief period, but has there been anything else that's helped your headache?"
3365,"No, not really.","OK. And is there any particular time of the day that the headache's worse, like, is, in the morning time when you're first waking up or later in the day?"

And if you do and it's high enough, that will increase the chance that you have a bacterial sinusitis,  and if so, with some of your symptoms, including the discharge, obstruction, loss of smell, and facial pain, that all fits the picture for it and also you had a period where you felt a little bit better and then worse again.

Is there anything that I'm missing?"
3839,"No, I think that covers all the symptoms.","And you might have potentially had, some exposure through your girlfriend potentially, so it's possible that, well, it's possible that you just have a cold, but it's also,  we'll still have to rule out covid as a cause, and so we'll have to do a covid swab and go from there and we'll check your temperature here as well. Just, uh, I think something that I forgot to ask, have you taken any medications that has helped you with your symptoms?"
3840,"Uh no, I haven't taken anything.","OK, alright, well, thank you, I'll go talk to my attending and we'll come back and discuss this further with you."
3841,"Yeah, I'm just feeling, so, I do have COPD, but I just feel so much worse. I do have shortness of breath, but I think it's just been worse over the past three days. I'm having more difficulty climbing stairs, or even just going to the bathroom.","OK, and you said this started?"
3842,"Three days ago, three or four days ago.",And since that time has the shortness of breath been getting worse or staying the same?
3843,"Yeah, so initially it was just, it was just climbing stairs, you know, but then after that, I mean, this morning, I was just short of breath going to the bathroom.","OK, and have you had, uh, shortness of breath on exertion like this before?"
3844,"Uhm, you know, sometimes.",OK.
3845,"I don't, do much anyway, because my CPD, you know, just makes things a little bit difficult, uh, yeah, I use my puffers.","OK, and have you had any, uh, episodes where you've woken up in the middle of the night and were really short of breath, you had to, uh, sit up?"

3849,"Yeah, yeah, so usually it's just sort of whiteish and foamy, and uh, yeah it's different. And it's more, you know, it's alot more, every time I'm coughing it's just like, spoonfuls, it's a lot more than usual.","OK, yeah, it sounds like a lot more and have you noticed any blood?"
3850,"No, no, no.","OK, and uh, so have you had a cough then?"
3851,"Oh yeah, I've had a cough for the past 20 years.","OK, and is your cough worse at any particular time of the day, Or does it happen throughout the day?"

3873,"Yeah, I think my doc prescribed some pills, I don't know, I don't remember what they are, I just take them every day.","OK, we can get that information. Have you had any hospitalizations?"
3874,"Uhm, I've been to the ER a couple of times and this one time, it was similar to this time, when I was having difficulties breathing and had to stay for about five days or so. I think that was two years ago.","OK, and how are your symptoms feeling now when compared to, uh, that time?"
3875,"I wasn't producing this green yellow thing that's coming out of my mouth right now. It was not that bad. It's just last time I was having difficulties breathing, so I decided to come in. But this time I just have this weird thing, I don't even feel like looking at it.","OK, yeah, for sure it sounds like there's something certainly going on here and Yeah, have you had any past surgeries?"
3876,"I had, uh, I had a knee replacement.","OK, and, uh, can you tell me a little bit about your living situation, like who do you live with and whereabouts?"

3884,I drink a glass or two every weekend.,"OK, and do use any other recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine?"
3885,No.,"OK, and, any family history of heart or lung conditions?"
3886,"Uhm, high blood pressure.","OK, has anybody in the family had lung cancer?"
3887,No.,"Alright, and, so you've been experiencing worsening sputum production that now has a green color to it, and now having a bit more, more short of breath, which sounds like COPD exacerbation, especially since it's a similar type of presentation as before. And so we'll order a chest X-ray, some blood gases and do a sputum culture and possibly start antibiotics, but, depending on the severity we may not not need to just yet. And then we'll also use some inhalers as well as inhaled steroid to help with the inflammation in the airways."
3888,Sure.,"Alright, we'll get that started."
3889,"Hi, my son Dave who's 5 years old, who comes to the clinic quite often, has uh, his asthma has been really bad over the past few days. I've tried his puffers, but they're not really helping much, and I'm just worried about him.",So what symptom is he experiencing now?

It's just, yeah, it's just, it seems like, it's just, he's not eating well either.","OK, so yeah, it's been affecting, uh, sleep, appetite, his mood, has he been short of breath?"
3891,"If he was like, he said that he was having some difficulty breathing, yeah.","OK, has he, uh, able to talk like in full sentences, like, how is he right now?"
3892,"Yeah, he's  able to talk in full sentences but he just gets a little bit breathless when he's eating, which I think is probably why he's not eating much. But yeah, he's able to talk, he's not talking much either, just been like, just been in a mood, you know, he gets a little bit breathless when he's crying.","OK, I see, and, has he had a cough?"

3907,"Uh, he's just been, he's just been not, he's not been as active as he usually is, so I don't, he hasn't said that any anything in particular about muscle pains, but I don't know if he knows how to, you know? He's just been, yeah.","OK, and two days ago, can you think of any triggers like, was there any exposure to dust or smoke or maybe even pets that could have brought this on?"
3908,"Yeah, you know, if I think about it, he did go outside to play with his brother and, I don't know he might have got something out there maybe.","Yeah, uh, certainly possible and was it like a particularly cold day?"

3915,I would love that.,"That's great, and has he been using any other medications to help over these last couple of days besides the inhalers?"
3916,"No, just the inhalers, we've also kept it the usual one, the one that he takes, the other inhaler.","OK, does he have one that he uses, once, like, he uses daily?"
3917,"Yeah, yeah the one that he uses, I think the orange one.","OK, so he does use a steroid inhaler?"

And it does sound like it could be an asthma exacerbation, and so we can trial some inhaler medications, a little bit different than what you use at home. But also using Ventolin as well and we'll assess the need for potential, uh, antibiotics and also steroid if necessary and if his breathing gets worse or you're starting to hear that the wheezing is getting worse or his work of breathing is becoming more intense then certainly we'll need to add on some oxygen and possibly, some other therapies."
3938,Thank you so much doc.,"Alright, thank you."

4012,Like 38 to 39.,"OK, so headache started four days ago. Is it persistent or constant or does it come and go?"
4013,"It was pretty constant, the headache kind of got better yesterday but last few days it's just been constant headache Pretty much every day.","OK, OK. Does anything make it better or worse?"
4014,"Just some rest and, uh, I tried to take some Tylenol to get rid of it, took some Advil as well. It did help a little bit, but it just kind of came back after the medication wore out.",How long does the headache last when you get it?
4015,"If I don't take medications, it can last honestly, the whole day.","OK, yeah, um, and if you were to describe it, is it sharp, dull, achy?"

4019,"Right now it's not that bad, probably like a two or three, but when it was, just a few days ago, it was like probably an 8 or 9.","Yeah, and then have you ever experienced something like this before?"
4020,"No, I'm not usually one to get headaches. My wife, she gets migraines, but like I rarely ever have headaches.","Yeah, OK, and then you mentioned the headache is getting a little bit better now?"

4046,"No, no cancers.","OK, do you smoke?"
4047,I used to when I was in my 30s. I quit a pretty long time ago.,"OK, how much did you smoke before that?"

4053,Not that I know of.,Do you still go to work?
4054,"I just have like a desk job. I have my own room. It's not like, I don't see too many people and like, when I do I'm wearing a mask so I don't think so.",OK.
4055,"I have stopped going to work though like, just in case.","OK, good and have you traveled to anywhere recently?"
4056,"No, we've been pretty homebound.","Pretty homebound, OK, alright, well that's good and those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for myself?"
4057,"Yeah, I don't know, what do you think is causing all of this?","Yeah, it sounds like you have some sort of infection, so the first thing we need to rule out is covid, of course. So we'll do a swab and those swabs should come back to you in about 24 to 48 hours and until then, it's important that you do isolate and you isolate for 14 days at least, and that includes from other people at home. And if those swabs come back negative, you could possibly have like, another infection. But if your symptoms worsen, like you start getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures or anything like that, you should come back to the ER and we'll get that checked out. And, so that's where we'll start for now, because your presentation is acute, we think it's likely infection related."
4058,"OK, that sounds good to me and should I be staying in my own room or anything like that at home?","Yeah, if you can like, it's recommended that you try to isolate in your own room for the next 14 days because your symptoms do overlap with that of covid, yeah."
4059,"OK, sounds good.Thank you.","Yeah, no worries, take care."
4060,"Yeah, so I just brought my son, went to the hospital. I've just been getting very concerned because he's making like these, like grunting noises for the last day and, like it's it's really worrying me, I don't know if he's like not breathing and I also just did like a temperature on him just this morning and it came up to like like a high 38, so I don't know what's going on, and then he's just very like irritable and just not himself I think.","OK, so all of this started a day ago, you mentioned?"
4061,"Yeah, it started yesterday, but the grunting started today, like, I think he was a bit on the warmer side last night as well, more irritable last night, but the grunting started this morning.","OK, Uhm, and you mentioned his fever was 38, correct?"
4062,"Yeah, I think it was like 38, 7 or something like that.",OK is he coughing at all?
4063,"Uhm, yeah, I would say with the grunting there is some coughing in between as well.","OK, and is he bringing up any phlegm?"
4064,"Uhm, he's been having some spit ups as well. They're mainly like clear and whitish, but yeah I don't know if he's bringing anything else up. There's no green or yellow material though.","OK, any blood in there?"
4065,"No, I haven't notice any blood.",Does he sound wheezy?
4066,"Uh no, it's mainly just the grunting.","OK, OK, does he look swollen to you?"
4067,"Uh, swollen as in just, uh, like in his.","In his, uh, like uh, legs, arms or belly area."
4068,"No, I don't think so.","No ok, and uh, does he have a runny nose or a stuffy nose?"
4069,"No, I don't think so.","No, OK, how is his feeding?"
4070,"Yeah, it's it's been difficult. So right now, like his mom is at home, but she was having difficulty feeding. He's mainly breastfed right now.",OK.
4071,And he's not really been feeding too much either.,"OK, and how about like the number of wet diapers he has?"
4072,"Just the normal like, that hasn't changed. He has like three or four in a day.","OK, OK, good. Have you noticed any changes to his bowel movements or urine?"
4073,"No, pretty much been the same.","OK, is he throwing up at all?"
4074,"Nope, just some spit ups, I don't know if that's, Just because of the coughing or if they're just spit ups, like, but nothing after eating.","OK, OK, have you noticed any rashes on him?"
4075,"No, no rashes.","OK, uhm, has he had any fainting spells or seizures?"
4076,"Uh, no, I've been really trying to make sure, like, I was worried if he gets blue or something that we would rush to the emergency department, but I haven't noticed anything like that.","OK, OK good. Has he been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?"
4077,"No, I don't think so. We've been trying to be very careful with the pandemic and everything going on.","For sure, any travel to anywhere recently?"
4078,No.,"OK, and is he an other-wise healthy baby?"
4079,"Yeah, so, uh, healthy but he was born premature at 36 weeks.",OK.
4080,"And no complications really with the pregnancy or after he was born. But yeah, he was premature.","OK, and so he didn't need any hospitalizations right after birth, right?"
4081,"No, he was fine after birth.",And no longstanding medical conditions after birth?
4082,No.,"Has he needed hospitalizations for anything in the past, or surgeries?"
4083,"No, nothing like that.","OK, and is he up to date with all his immunizations?"
4084,"Yeah, the two months vaccinations are all up to date.","OK, good. Medication-wise is he on anything?"
4085,"No, no medications.","OK, any allergies?"
4086,No.,Any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?
4087,"No, not that we know of.","OK, any cancers in the family?"
4088,Nope.,And who does he live with at home?
4089,Just me and my wife.,"OK, uhm, in a house, apartment?"
4090,In a house.,"OK, any old carpets, mold, dust, asbestos, pets, anything like that at home?"
4091,"No, nothing like that.","OK, and does anyone at home smoke?"
4092,Nope.,"OK, well, those were all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?"
4093,"Yeah, no, I was just really worried like, the grunting is just really scaring us. So do you, I was just wondering if you know what it could be.","Yeah, so the grunting is worrisome. He could have anything from bronchiolitis to pneumonia so what we'll do is, we'll, first get his temperature, we'll get his O2 sat and we will get some imaging done as well to see if it's more in line with bronchiolitis or pneumonia. If it's bronchiolitis, it will be supportive treatment so we can keep him here at the hospital because he is in some distress and we'll keep him hydrated and give him some oxygen. And if it's pneumonia, we'll prescribe him some antibiotics. How does that sound?"
4094,"Yeah, and will he need to stay in the hospital at all?","Yeah so for now, because, if he is in any distress and if he needs oxygen, and IV hydration, he'll need to stay in the hospital until he's better from that standpoint. I should also mention, we should do a covid swab on him as well because his symptoms are in line with covid as well, so we'll have to do that to rule it out."
4095,"OK, yeah, that sounds good, Uh, uh, yeah, thank you so much.","Yeah, no worries."
4096,"Yeah, so I just came in today, I actually had asthma as a kid and I used to be on the puffers and it pretty much resolved by the time I was around like 18 years old, and I've been pretty good since then. I haven't even been really using the puffers for the last five years, but just recently, just during the winter I started noticing some of my symptoms coming back and now, especially over the last few months whenever I'm doing something like going to the gym or exercising, I do get that shortness of breath and I feel my throat closing in again and recently for the last, I would say a week I've also been having some wheezing as well. So yeah, I just wanted to come back and make sure everything is alright.","OK sure, so just to rewind a little bit. When were you first diagnosed with asthma?"
4097,"So I was diagnosed when I was, I think it was like when I was 13 years old.","13, OK, and you've been using Puffers since?"
4098,"So yeah, in the last, I would say two months I've noticed it, similarly to when I was younger, especially when I'm on the treadmill or running, I get short of breath very easily. But at rest I'm fine, I don't have any trouble, but I've noticed it for the last few months.","OK, so it's mostly when you're exercising or with activities?"
4099,Mhm.,OK. And do you feel wheezy as well?
4100,"Yeah, in the last one to two weeks I would say I'm also wheezing as well. Mainly during like, if I'm running or still, with exercise, I feel myself wheezing. Yeah, so that's been an issue for the last couple of weeks.","So once you stop activity, does your shortness of breath and wheezing eventually resolve?"
4101,"Yeah, yeah, so I just have to kind of sit down and relax for a bit and then it goes away on its own.","OK, how long does it last before it goes away?"
4102,"Probably, at least, like I would say 10 to 15 minutes.","OK, OK."
4103,Until I'm fully kind of recovered.,"Ok, Ok. Are You coughing as well?"
4104,"Uhm, yeah, when I'm exercising, that's when all of that happens. The wheezing, the coughing, but throughout the day otherwise, I'm not coughing.","OK. And, when you cough, do you bring up phlegm or is it more like a dry cough?"
4105,"No, no, nothing like that.","No, you don't feel like you're breathing a lot more than usual?"
4106,"Uh, no, I don't think so.","OK, Do you still have puffers at home?"
4107,"I actually, like I haven't used them for a while so no I don't have any puffers.",OK. Any weight loss recently?
4108,No.,"No, fevers or chills?"
4109,"No, nothing like that.","OK, any rashes or changes in your hair or skin or nails?"
4110,"I do, I have just, uh, eczeme, I've had it for most of my life now, so especially during the winter I do get some irritation, especially on my hands. So yeah, some rashes, but that's about it.","OK, any changes in your vision or hearing?"
4111,"No, no changes.","Stuffy nose, runny nose, changes in your taste?"
4112,No.,Changes in smell?
4113,No.,Chest pain?
4114,No chest pain.,Do you find you get short of breath when you're laying down or it wakes you up at night?
4115,"No, just when I'm exercising, especially running.","OK, sure, any dizziness or fainting spells?"
4116,No.,Any headaches?
4117,No headaches.,"Any like, reflux, heartburn?"
4118,No.,"Nausea, vomiting?"
4119,No.,Changes to your bowel movements?
4120,Nope.,"OK, so you mentioned you were diagnosed with asthma and eczema in the past, any other longstanding medical conditions that you have?"
4121,"Uh, no those those are the only ones.","OK, any allergies?"
4122,"I do have, I think like, just seasonal allergies. I don't know if I'm allergic to pollen, but during the spring time I get allergies and then during the winter now I'm getting some of these symptoms that I'm talking about. So yeah, but none to any medications that I know of.","OK, so you're not getting any night time symptoms, and you're only getting day time symptoms with activity, right?"
4123,Yeah.,Has this prevented you from going to work or school?
4124,"Oh yeah, so I, just this past week, I usually do my running, like morning workout right before work, and just one of the days after I worked out, I felt just terrible, with this coughing and short of breath so I just decided to take a day off work that day. But then I realized it kind of goes away on its own, so for the other days I have been going to work.","OK, OK, good. And, alright, and then any medications that you're on?"
4125,"I'm on a, Just one of those steroid creams for my eczema.","OK, OK. Are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
4126,Yep.,"OK, uhm, how about family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?"
4127,"No heart conditions, but yeah asthma is pretty big in my family, as well as eczema, like my mom has it, my sister has it, so yeah asthma is pretty big.","OK, how about cancers?"
4128,"Uhm, no, I don't think anyone in the family has any cancers.","OK, and do you smoke?"
4129,"No, I've never smoked. I'm pretty health focused and I can't even take if someone else is smoking, so no.","No, OK. Do you drink alcohol?"
4130,"No, I don't drink alcohol, no drugs, yeah, I'm pretty, I like to stay very fit and healthy so nothing like that.","OK, and have you been in contact with any sick people recently?"
4131,"No, not that I know of. I live by myself in my apartment. I've been working from home. I work as a programmer and so I only go outside for runs and stuff for groceries, so I haven't really seen anyone sick around me.","Yeah, and have you traveled anywhere recently?"
4132,"No, I've mainly been at home.","OK, good, and where's home?"
4133,Home is in Hamilton Ontario and I've just been working from home.,"OK, do you live in a house, apartment, who do you live with?"
4134,"I just live in an apartment by myself. I did have a roommate, like uh, that moved out just a couple of months ago. But yeah, right now I'm just by myself.","OK, OK, any old carpets, pets, mold or asbestos in the house?"
4135,"No, nothing like that.","OK, good. So those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for myself?"
4136,"Yeah, I was just wondering if I should go back on the puffers. I don't have any right now, I just don't know if my asthma has just uh, come back.","Yeah so, what we're gonna do is, we're going to do a PFT, so pulmonary function test on you, cause it's been a while since you've had one of those done. And that's just to check how well your lung is functioning, so we'll do that. We'll also maybe get a chest X-ray as well for baseline and depending on what those two come back as, we'll probably get you to use your short acting beta agonist puffer again and we'll also give you a long acting."
4137,OK.,"As well as an inhaled cortico steroid. So, actually, you know what, we'll give you an inhaled cortico steroid and a short acting beta agonist because you can't use both the steroid and the long, so we'll start with those two. We'll start with the short acting as well as inhaled cortico steroid. And if we find that your asthma is just based on like, exertion or like something called athletic asthma, we can also try something called Cromolyn instead but we'll discuss that more. Right now our priority is to get your symptoms under control, so we'll start with the short acting as well as the inhaled cortico steroid. How does that sound?"
4138,"Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you so much.","Yeah, no problem."
4139,"Yeah, I'm just coming in with my son, he's been having, he's been complaining of just, seems like pain in his right ear for the last I would say three to four days. And it seems like he's just more irritable, just not himself right now.","Yeah OK, so, how long did you say he's had this ear pain?"
4140,I would say four days now.,"Four days, OK. Have you noticed any hearing loss?"
4141,"Uh, no, he still responds when I call his name.","OK and, have you noticed any fluid coming out of his ears?"
4142,"Uh, no, I don't think so.",Is it more like one side of his ears or is it both ears?
4143,It's just his right ear.,"Just his right ear, OK. And have you noticed that it's like, swollen, red or warm?"
4144,"Uh, no, I don't see any swelling or redness at all.","OK, OK, good, and have you taken a look inside his ears?"
4145,"Yeah, I tried to take a look with a flashlight. I couldn't really see too much.","OK, yeah, that's fair. And you mentioned he's had a runny nose too, When did that start?"
4146,"Yeah, so that, kind of like last week he was recovering from, I think it was just a cold and he had a runny nose and just was a bit congested. But then over the last week it kind of just resolved. But then this week he started having just this ear pain.",OK. Any fevers?
4147,"Uh, no, not that I, I haven't measured anything and he hasn't mentioned any, like he hasn't felt cold or anything like that.","OK, any weight loss over the past month or so?"
4148,No.,"No, any change in his hair or nails, like rashes or, sorry, or skin?"
4149,"Yeah, no, I haven't seen any changes in the skin.","OK, any changes in his vision or smell or taste?"
4150,No.,"No, OK. His runny nose, what color is it?"
4151,"It was mainly, uh, it seemed to me like it was mainly clear when it was happening, like he wasn't bringing up any yellow or green material.","OK, good. Does he have a sore throat at all?"
4152,"No, not that he's told me. He's still eating things and I don't think he's having any trouble with eating anything, so I don't think so.","OK, that's good. Has he had a cough?"
4153,"Uhm, actually he did. He did start coughing like yesterday, but just a few times a day. I don't know if it's because of this or like, what else might be going on.","OK, and you said for the past few days, he's had the cough?"
4154,"Yeah, I think just maybe started yesterday.","Started yesterday, OK. Is it a dry cough or is it, is he bringing up any phlegm?"
4155,"No, it seems to be just dry. I think I just noticed it like three or four times during the day yesterday.","OK, so no blood that he's bringing up right?"
4156,"No, no.","OK, and does he have any shortness of breath?"
4157,"No, no.","No, OK, any wheezing?"

4168,"Uh, no, like, he's mainly just been inside his home.",OK. has he ever had ear pain before?
4169,"He did have a similar pain, I think when he was like around three years old, but it happened with his left left ear, not the right one.","OK, was he prescribed any medications?"
4170,"Uh yeah, he was given a, like a course of antibiotics at that time. I forgot what it was called, but I think at that time it was much worse, like he, I don't know if he was just younger and couldn't tolerate it but I think he also had a fever at that time.","OK, OK, and then any other ear infections outside of that one time."
4171,"No, I think that, only that one I can recall.","OK, alright, is he otherwise healthy?"
4172,"Yeah, otherwise he's healthy. No, other conditions or anything like that.",No hospitalizations or surgeries?
4173,No.,And is he on any medications?
4174,No medications.,"OK, is he up to date with all his immunizations?"
4175,"Yeah, all his immunizations are good.","OK, any allergies?"
4176,Not that we know of so far.,And any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions.
4177,"No lung or heart conditions. Just, his father does have like celiac disease, so I don't know if that's related at all.","OK, how old was he when was diagnosed with celiac?"
4178,"Fairly young I would say, in his 20s.","OK, OK, uhm, alright, we'll keep an eye on it in him, like if he has any changes in his bowel movements or if he's getting severe abdominal pain after eating certain foods with gluten you can get him checked up for that as well."
4179,OK.,"Yeah and then, in terms of where he lives, does he live with you and your partner?"
4180,"Yeah, so it's just, he's an only child, lives with me and my husband, and also we have like a pet dog.","OK, do you live in an apartment or in a house?"
4181,"We live in a, it's like a condominium.","OK, OK, any old carpet, mold or asbestos in the building?"
4182,"No, no, nothing like that. It's fairly well kept.","OK, And is he other-wise like developmental-wise, he's OK? There's no past history of like developmental disorders, anything like that?"
4183,"No, no issues from like when he was younger like no complaints at all. I Think he was doing the same as every other child.","OK, no complications during your pregnancy with him, no complications during the actual delivery and then when he was a newborn?"
4184,"Uh no, no complications, it was just a vaginal birth at 39 weeks and we didn't need to stay in the hospital at all afterwards.","OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?"
4185,"Yeah, I don't know if, uh, like last time we did get some antibiotics. I don't know if he needs them right now or what would you recommend?","Yeah, uhm so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before I can come up with like a management plan for him. So once I do, if I see, uhm, if his tympanic membrane has been perforated or I see pus in there, we'll prescribe him like 10 days of antibiotics. We can give him either Amoxicillin, or if he has bad reactions to penicillins,  we can give him Cefuroxime and then if, uh, it doesn't seem to have any systemic symptoms, so if he has systemic symptoms like fever, which we'll check for today, and if he's like been really ill and he has like a middle ear effusion or bulging tympanic membrane, again we'll give him antibiotics for 10 days. But if his tympanic membrane is just bulging a little bit, or if he has some middle ear effusion but no systemic symptoms, like, no fevers, and he seems to be fine otherwise, we'll reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see if he's better and if he's not, again, will prescribe him antibiotics. How does that sound?"
4186,"Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.","OK yeah, no worries."
4187,"Yeah, so my daughter, she's had this hoarse voice for the past like two or three days. It doesn't seem to be getting better. In fact, it's getting worse and she just doesn't sound like herself anymore and she's not speaking as much.","OK, and when did this start?"
4188,"OK, so she had a cough like four days ago, and she's still coughing a little bit, but not as much as she was before, but it's more her voice that I'm concerned about. It sounds very hoarse and harsh.","OK, and so how many days has she had the hoarse voice for?"
4189,I'd say about two or three days now.,"Two or three days, OK. And when she was coughing, you mentioned like previously was she coughing up any sputum or was it more of a dry cough?"
4190,It was more of a dry cough,And the cough has pretty much resolved by now?
4191,"Yeah, she still gets them once in a while, but yeah, it's pretty much gone.","OK, and when she was coughing, did she at all bring up any kind of blood or any green or yellowish material?"
4192,No,"No, OK. Did she have any fevers at all, recently?"
4193,"Uh, no, no fevers.","OK. And does she have any kind of, uh, along with a hoarse voice, does she have any pain with talking?"
4194,"Yes, I think so.","OK, and does she have any pain with swallowing any foods or liquids?"
4195,"She's eating and drinking ok, but I suspect there is some pain.","OK, So how long has she, so she has a sore throat, how long has she had that for?"
4196,The sore throat? Uhm I would say for the past two or three days as well.,"OK, and was there anything that, so she had kind of like a cough previously, but anything else, anyone sick around her, or anything you think might have precipitated some of her symptoms?"
4197,"No, not that I know of. I don't think she's had any contacts with sick people recently.","OK. Are there any, have you tried any medications over the counter, that has helped her?"
4198,"Uhm, not over the counter medications, but like I tried to get her to like gargle with like salt water and all that kind of stuff, but that didn't seem to help.",OK. And have her symptoms been just constant or do they come and go?
4199,They've been pretty constant.,"OK, and you think her symptoms are getting worse?"
4200,"Uh, no, they've been pretty consistent, but maybe the harsh voice is getting worse.","OK. And other than the symptoms that you've mentioned, has she had any kind of shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain or anything like that?"
4201,"No, nothing like that.","OK, and no fevers, right?"

4204,"Uhm, no.","No, any nausea or vomiting?"
4205,"Uh, no, nothing like that.","OK, any runny nose or congestion?"
4206,No.,"No, OK. And have you had a chance to at all, look into her mouth and throat? And if you have, have you noticed any kind of redness, swelling?"
4207,"I haven't looked in there too much, like, just an inspection the other day, it looked a little bit red, but I didn't see any discharge.","OK, and have you noticed any kind of swelling around her neck, ears, like, around her lymph nodes?"
4208,"Uhm, I haven't actually taken a look there.","OK, we can do that. Other than those symptoms, has she been experiencing any kind of like fatigue or have you notice her being just very tired?"
4209,"Um, she has seemed a little bit more tired than usual.","OK, and right now is she going to school or is right now all like virtual? Is she at home?"
4210,"Uhm, she's at home right now.","OK, and does she have any symptoms of, any chest pain at all?"
4211,No chest pain.,"OK, any changes in her bowel movements, any Constipation, diarrhea?"
4212,No.,"OK, any urinary problems?"
4213,No.,"OK, has she been able to sleep well or does she wake up a lot more at night?"
4214,"Uhm, she's been able to sleep well, yeah","OK, how about her appetite?"
4215,"Its been pretty normal. She's not eating as much as she used to, but she's still eating and drinking ok.","OK, and have you noticed any kind of weight changes at all recently has she lost any weight?"
4216,No,"OK, and, has she had any loss of taste, of smell or sorry, loss of sense of taste or smell at all."
4217,"Uh, no.",Any muscle aches or anything like that?

4221,"Uhm, no, nothing like that.",Any like asthma or any other conditions?
4222,No.,"OK, any allergies that you know of?"

4225,No.,"No, OK. Are there any family history of any lung or heart conditions?"
4226,"Uh, no.",Any cancers?
4227,There's some colon cancer on her dad side of the family.,"OK, and is there any, so do you remember who the person is and also like when they got diagnosed with the colon cancer?"
4228,So it was her uncle. He was diagnosed when he was forty five.,"OK, other than that, were there any developmental challenges at all while she was growing up? Did she, was she meeting her milestones? Any concerns at all?"
4229,"she's at home with myself, my husband and she has one younger sibling.","OK and, is everyone at home well, does anyone have any of these symptoms?"
4230,"No, OK.","Right, so, and in terms of the home environment, does anyone smoke in the house?"
4231,No.,"No OK, alright so I think that's all the questions I had right now. Do you have any questions or concerns?"
4232,"No, no questions, but uhm, actually, what do you think she has and how can we treat her?","Yeah, so it seems like that the hoarseness of voice and the sore throat and her symptoms mostly align with what's called laryngitis, and this is usually caused by like just a viral respiratory infection. The hoarseness of voice will usually last more than a week and up to like ten days and it should resolve on its own. But we'll definitely take a better look and do a proper physical examination, see if I see any kind of swelling, redness, or any like white streaks or exudates around her pharynx as well. So after we take a look, we'll see what we can do. It doesn't seem like, it can also be a bacterial infection, in which case we would need to give her antibiotics, but usually it's a viral infection that should go away on its own. So we would just kind of wait and see and potentially just give her voice some rest during this period, and just go on from there. Do you have any other questions or concerns?"
4233,"Uh no, that sounds great, thank you.","You're welcome and yeah, we'll, just do a full examination and then go from there."
4234,"OK, sounds great thanks.",You're welcome.  Take care.
4235,"Sure, I've been feeling very short of breath for the past, uh, two weeks, but even before that, I started feeling a little bit short of breath and I can't stop coughing and it just feels like it's really hard for me to breathe.","OK, so this started two weeks ago?"
4236,"Yeah, it started two weeks ago.","OK, and you're also coughing?"
4237,Yeah.,"OK, and how long have you been coughing for?"
4238,"The same amount of time, it started about, maybe three weeks ago, I started coughing more, um, but now it's worse.","OK, and what kind of cough are you having? Is it a wet cough or a dry cough?"
4239,It's definitely wet. My phlegm looks green.,"OK, and how long have you noticed it being green?"
4240,It's been like that for the past two weeks.,"OK, and before that, were you having coughing as well?"
4241,"Yeah, before that I was still coughing but not as much.","OK, uhm, and was there anything that happened, uh, did you get sick at all recently, or were you in contact with anyone who was sick?"

4246,It's pretty constant now.,"OK. And have you had at all any kind of, uh, fevers or anything like that?"
4247,No fevers.,"OK, and how about your shortness of breath? Is that, when does that happen? Is it mainly with exercise and exertion, or can it happen even when you're just going on about your day?"
4248,"Uhm, its, uh, ok, its more with exertion, but right now even at rest, I'm coughing and feeling short of breath.","OK. And are you feeling at all any kind of, uh, chest tightness or pain?"
4249,"Uh, yeah, some chest tightness.","And is that mainly when you're coughing and short of breath or, uhm, at other times as well?"
4250,"Uhm, other times as well.","OK. Are you having any other, any other like, can you describe your chest pain a little bit? Is it kind of a pressure pain or is it a sharp pain, aching pain? How would you describe it?"
4251,"Uhm, I would say it's a, uh, it's a tightness in my chest. And it feels, I guess throbbing or achy?","OK, and does this pain, uhm, move to anywhere else or does it just stay in your chest?"
4252,"Uh, it just stays in my chest.","OK, have you been feeling dizzy or have you fainted at all?"
4253,"Uh, no.",Have you been feeling increased sweating and confusion? Anything like that?
4254,No.,"OK, have you felt your heart racing and anything like that?"
4255,No.,"OK. Alright, and is there anything that makes your symptoms better or worse?"

4261,"Ah, sometimes I feel sweaty, but that's just with the shortness of breath.","OK, and how long does your shortness of breath usually last?"
4262,"It lasts about, uh, I don't know, I kind of feel short of breath all the time, but when it's really bad, it lasts about five-ten minutes and then it goes back to like my normal shortness of breath.",OK. And has this happened to you before?
4263,"Uhm no, I don't think so.",OK.
4264,"Like not, not this bad, I've always had some shortness of breath but nothing like this.","OK. And , uh, do you have any kind of diarrhea or constipation?"
4265,"Uhm, no nothing like that.","OK, how about fatigue?"
4266,"Yeah, I feel fatigued.","OK, and is that just about today or is it, do you think it's because of your shortness of breath?"
4267,"Yeah, it's probably cause of my shortness of breath.",Are you having any of these symptoms when you're trying to sleep?
4268,"uh yeah, I think its, yeah when I'm laying down sometimes I feel more short of breath than usual, but once I shift positions it goes back to it's normal.","Ok. Is it, do you ever have to wake up at night to catch a breath or anything like that?"
4269,"Ah, no, it doesn't wake me up.","And have you noticed any kind of, uh, significant weight loss or anything like that recently?"

And I guess I have a short acting as well for when I need it.","OK. And do you have, so is it just the two, two puffers?"
4280,Mhm.,"OK, and are you using, like the blue one, the blue one more at all, are you having to use the short acting one more?"

4294,"Yeah, I get it from like a medical dispensary.","OK, OK, I see. Yeah, I just want to make sure because some, if you get it from other sources there might be more irritants in there that can cause some of your symptoms and for them to get worse as well. So yeah."
4295,"Oh I see, I see, OK.","Yeah, and other than that, do you have any questions or concerns at all?"
4296,"No, what do you think I should do from, For now?","Yeah, so right now what we're going to do is because you're having the coughing, shortness of breath, and you have a history of COPD & CHF, we definitely want to make sure that you're not having, uhm, what I think you might be having isn't just an exacerbation of your COPD, and especially with the green sputum it might be like a bacterial infection that's causing your symptoms to get worse, so we'll do all the appropriate testing, we'll do, a chest X-ray, we'll get some blood work done as well, w'ell give you some uh, Ventolin as well while you're here, and we might give you like a steroid medication as well. So we'll do some of those things right now for you to kind of help you right now, as well as do some of those tests that I mentioned. Depending on what comes back, you might require an admission to the hospital just because we want to make sure you don't go home with an exacerbation, especially with the CHF as well, we need to, we will need to get that under control because that can get worse with your COPD exacerbation as well. So we need to make sure some of that, swelling goes down, if we need to adjust your medications while you're here. So yeah, let's just, I'll get back to you, we'll do some of those testing and then see where to go from there. Is that OK?"
4297,"Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.",You're welcome.
4298,"Yeah, um, so I have been, I have this cough, I'm coughing up blood so that's made me a little bit worried, um, so I thought I should come and get, get it investigated.","OK, yeah no definitely, that, that's definitely concerning, is, so when did this start?"

4305,I have a big family so we all live together.,OK.
4306,"Uh, so it's yeah, so there are about like ten of us.","OK great, so it started one, you said around one and a half weeks ago."
4307,"Yeah, that's right.","OK, and is it like a constant cough? Or does it come and go?"
4308,"It's uh, it's pretty constant, well, I guess it comes and goes, it's, it's not there all the time.","OK, and have you had this happen before at all?"
4309,"No, never.","OK. Right, is there anything that makes your symptoms better or worse?"
4310,"Uhm, I don't think so, nothing that, nothing I've tried has worked.","OK, and do you have any other symptoms like a fever or shortness of breath, anything like that?"
4311,"I have been feeling chills and uhm, I haven't actually taken my temperature, but I feel hot, so it's possible that I have a fever.","OK, and do you, do you have any significant weight loss at all in the past few weeks?"

4314,"Yes, yeah, I've been having night sweats. I thought that was just me being hot, but I guess, I feel chilly and then I have night sweats so I probably do have a fever.","OK, and how about fatigue? Are you, do you feel more tired throughout the day?"

4322,"No, I don't think so. I haven't asked them, but nothing I've seen.","OK, and previously do you have any medical conditions that you were diagnosed with?"
4323,"Nope, I'm healthy otherwise.","OK, any allergies?"
4324,"No, no allergies.","OK, any kind of loss of taste or smell?"

4326,"Uhm, no, just some vitamins.","OK, and any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?"
4327,"Uh, no.","OK, other than that, have you had any family history of any heart or lung conditions?"
4328,"Nope, nothing like that.","OK, uhm, currently right now, so you live with roommates. Is it like an apartment, is it a home, like a house?"
4329,I live in an apartment.,"OK, uhm, do you currently smoke?"
4330,No.,"OK, do you drink alcohol?"
4331,No.,Any recreational drugs like marijuana?
4332,No.,"No, OK, alright, so those are all the questions we had. Do you have any questions or concerns?"
4333,"No, what do you think I have and is there anything I need to do right now?","Yeah, So what, uh, some of your symptoms are concerning, especially the coughing up blood, which is something that we always think of with tuberculosis. You don't have any history of, uh, family history of lung cancer or anything like that, so right now, especially since you just moved from India where tuberclosis is endemic, we need to make sure that we test you for tuberculosis. In the meantime though, you will need to stay in the hospital and be in an isolated room, uh, where we can filter some of the air and make sure, it's a very infective condition if you do have it so while you're getting all the tests done, you will need to stay here in an isolated room. Also, we will get some sputum smears and cultures to test for TB and we will also, I will need to, if the test comes back positive we will need to contact public health and let your contacts know as well. Lastly, we will also be getting, since you're having the hemoptysis, like coughing up blood, we will, we might also do a chest X-ray to see if"
4334,OK,"So those are, those are some of the things that we'll get started with. Is that OK with you? Any questions or concerns?"
4335,"Uhm, no nothing like that, uhm do I need to isolate?","Yeah, so we will keep you in an isolated room right now, when you're getting all those tests. And if you do have TB, you will need to isolate, uhm, and stay away from contacts, not be at work, we will, if you do in fact have TB, which it seems likely right now, you will be started in hospital on a ,like antibiotic therapy, uh, which consists of like four different medications and people with the active TB will do have to isolate during that time period, so yeah, we'll get some of those tests done and, we'll get back to you as soon as possible."
4336,"OK, great, thank you.",You're welcome.
4337,"Uhm, so I've had this runny nose, well first it was a stuffy nose, but now I've had this runny nose for the past week and a half and it doesn't seem to be getting any better. So I was just wondering if you could give me something for that?","Yeah, so yeah, let's just try to first see what's going on. So you've been having this, so when did it start getting stuffy?"
4338,"Uhm, it started getting stuffy about two weeks ago.","Two weeks ago, and when did it start getting, like just a runny nose?"

4345,"Uhm, they are pretty constant.","OK, and is there anything that you have tried that has helped you with these symptoms? Any over the counter medications?"
4346,"No, I haven't tried anything. I've been thinking about using some nasal decongestion but I don't want to make my runny nose any worse.","Yeah, no, that's a, that's a fair point. And yeah, there's multiple things that you can try over the counter, but we can get into that more later. Are you having any other symptoms at all, like any, shortness of breath, chest pain, any kind of dizziness, anything like that?"
4347,"No dizziness, I feel like sometimes I have a headache though, because I feel like there's a lot of fluid or something backed up into my sinuses.","OK, so do you, are you feeling, that pressure in your face at all?"
4348,"Mhm, a little bit, yeah.",OK. Have you at all in the past couple weeks to a month had contact with anyone that was sick?

4370,No.,Any recreational drugs like marijuana?
4371,No.,OK. And do you drink alcohol?
4372,Once in a while I'll have like a glass of wine every week.,"OK. And yeah, those are pretty much all the questions I have right now. Do you have any questions?"
4373,"Uh, no, what can I do about this runny nose?","Yeah, so it seems like it's been going on for more than one and a half week. What, what is reassuring is that you're not having any other symptoms that are concerning, like you're not having any cough, you're not having any green or yellow sputum, you're not having any fevers, so it seems that you might just be having a cold, which can be caused by just a viral, uh, infection, but it should go away on its own. Just make sure that you're getting some rest, you're hydrating well, uhm, you can get some over the counter medications like Tylenol cold for example, but for now I would say we should just wait and watch. But just in case, also, since it is one of the symptoms that's for covid as well, in this time period we will just get a covid swab just in case, but most likely it's nothing to be worried about. Until you get your test, I would recommend staying isolated. And then we can go on from there, is that, does that sound good to you?"
4374,"Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you so much.","You're welcome, take care."
4375,You too.,Bye.
4376,"Yeah, so I've had this cough now, it's been going on for about two weeks, just, just hasn't gone away.","Uhm, oK, can you tell me a little bit more about this cough? Is it dry or wet?"
4377,"Uh, yeah it's been, uhm, mix, it's been dry sometimes and I have had a little bit of sputum production recently, uh, it's been mostly clear though.",Has the cough gotten worse over the past two weeks?
4378,"No, it's been about the same.","Uhm, and have you had any blood that came up with the sputum?"
4379,"No, I haven't noticed any blood.","Alright, what about any other symptoms over the past two weeks? Have you had, have you had any fevers or chills?"
4380,"Not, no.","No. OK. And any uhm, I guess, any runny nose?"
4381,"Yeah, my nose was a bit runny last week, but it's, that's better now.","OK. OK, uhm, it's just, OK last week, what else, what other symptoms did you have last week?"
4382,"Yeah, I had a sore throat and a little bit of a headache as well, uhm, and, and some aches and fatigue. Those were uh, yeah, that was last week for about three days, and then I started to feel better. But I still have this cough, that, it's still going on.","So those other symptoms that you had last week that lasted about three days, are they all gone? are you still feeling fatigued or having a headache?"
4383,"Those are both, yeah, they're gone.","Hmm, It's only the cough?"
4384,Yeah I just have the cough.,"Is there any time, any specific time of the day that it's worse or better? Anything that triggers it?"
4385,"Uhm, maybe like, maybe when I went out into the cold or, uhm, like, when I went for a run where I really kind of exerted myself, it brought it on, but other than those things, nothing.","OK, but you're otherwise feeling better?"
4386,"Yeah, for the most part, yeah, feeling better, but I still have a cough.","OK. Uhm, have you had any chest pain?"
4387,"Uhm, no. Nothing like that.","Any other symptoms such as belly pain or diarrhea or Constipation or changes in your urine, are having any urinary symptoms?"
4388,"No, I haven't had anything like, like that.","OK. OK, and can you tell me about your past medical history, any medical conditions you have?"
4389,"Yeah, I, I'm healthy. I haven't, been diagnosed with, with anything.","OK alright, any medications that you take including over the counter pills or any herbal pills or multi vitamins etc."
4390,"Yeah, I'm taking a birth control.","I see. OK, any allergies?"
4391,No allergies.,"OK. Do you have any, you don't have any lungs related diseases right? Like asthma or COPD or anything of that sort?"
4392,"Uhm, no, nothing like that.","Alright alright, that's good,  and who do you currently live with, and where do you live?"
4393,"Alright, so I live with a few roommates. I'm just finishing up my undergraduate degree.","Yeah, that's great. Have you had any contact with anyone who was sick recently?"
4394,"No, not that I could think of, I mean we went out one night last week and that's kind of when I had those other symptoms for a few days after that.","OK, OK. Uhm and have you traveled outside the city or country?"
4395,"No, I haven't.","No, ok. Do you drink alcohol?"
4396,"Sometimes yeah, I, I will with friends, kind of socially.",alright.
4397,Just a few drinks.,What about smoking?
4398,"Uh, no.",Marijuana?
4399,"Uh, sometimes with, like socially with friends, but that might be once a month or probably even less.",Any recreational drugs?
4400,No.,"OK, alright and any lung conditions that run in the family?"
4401,No.,"OK, uhm, OK alright, so that's all that I, I wanted to know. It sounds like you had a, you had a cold last week and you just have this residual cough that's still there, and it's been two weeks and you're just worried about it, but otherwise you're feeling well, you don't have any other symptoms. Often times when we get sick, or we have an infection or inflammation of the, uhm, the airway, we can get a cough that lasts a long time and it might just take you a couple more weeks for the cough to go away. But if you feel that it's getting any worse or you're, you have those symptoms come back again, or you develop a fever, we can, you can definitely, we can do something more about that. I'll also do a physical exam and, and see how you're doing and then we can go from there."
4402,"Yeah, so I've had this cough that started within the last day and uhm, I've also been particularly short of breath as well.","OK. Can you tell me about the, the cough, how, is it dry cough or wet cough?"
4403,"It's wet, I've been bringing up, uh, sputum that's uh, It's just, it leaves a really bad taste in my mouth when bringing it up.",What color is the sputum?
4404,"It's kind of, uh, like, yellowish green, type color.",Havey you noticed any blood?
4405,"No, I haven't seen any blood.","And it only started yesterday. What about the difficulties breathing, when did that start?"
4406,"Yeah, that started really within the last twelve hours or so.",And can you tell me if it's gotten better or worse since then?
4407,"Yeah, it's been, it's been getting worse, uhm, and the phlegm, also smells really bad.","OK. When do you have difficult, like, is there anything that makes the, shortness of breath, worse?"
4408,"Yeah, if I, uhm, when I was having a cigarette earlier today, it got a bit worse and when I went out to get the Mail today I, I just couldn't do it. I, I had to just sit down.","And that what happened to you before, right?"
4409,"I was yeah, I wasn't sick at all.","OK, so you've had this bad cough and you've had some difficulties breathing since yesterday. Have you had a headache at all?"
4410,"No, no headache.","Any, uh, runny nose?"
4411,"No, it's really, no.",Any congestion?
4412,No.,"No, OK. Have you had any pain in your chest?"
4413,"Uh, no pain.",When you're breathing in or breathing out any pain at that time? or deep breathing?
4414,"No, I haven't had any pain.","OK, have you had any palpitations or you feel like your heart's racing?"
4415,"Uh, yeah, I do. I feel like my heart has been beating a little bit faster.",OK. And any pain in your belly?
4416,No.,Nausea or vomiting?
4417,"Uh no, but, well I guess I have felt a little nauseous with the, uhm, bad taste in my mouth.","OK, and any uh diarrhea or Constipation?"
4418,"Uhm no, I haven't anything like that.","OK, any sore throat?"
4419,"Uhm, no.","OK alright uhm, any other symptoms that I haven't talked about, that you experienced over the past day?"
4420,"No, it's really been, uhm, yeah, this cough and bringing up this, this sputum and being short of breath.","OK, uhm, can you tell me about your past uh, medical history, do you have any medical conditions?"
4421,"Uh yeah, I have uhm, high blood pressure.",Mhm.
4422,"I also have acid reflux, so uh, gerd I think, think it's called?",Yeah.
4423,"And, uhm, high cholesterol as well.","OK, ok."
4424,"And I've also been, had issues with anxiety in the past as well.","In terms of medications, are you taking any?"
4425,"Yeah, I take uhm, an ACE inhibitor, statin, uhm, and uh, medication for my stomach, I think, like Pantoprazole.","OK, and uh, how well has your gerd been controlled?"
4426,"Uh, it kind of, it bugs me most days, its not so bad, I mean, sometimes I'll get a little bit of heartburn and acid in the, in my mouth, but it depends on what I eat so I really try to stay away from some, some foods.","So the PPI hasn't completely curbed the, the acid reflux, you still get it?"
4427,"Yeah, I still get it. It's definitely helped though it was a lot worse before, uh starting it. I've been on been on it now for a few years.","OK, and as for your anxiety, do you ever get panic attacks?"
4428,"No, I haven't had any, any panic attacks.","OK, alright. Do you have any allergies?"
4429,No.,"OK, so you said that these symptoms started yesterday and they were quite sudden, uh, was there anything that you were doing yesterday or the day before that was different or unusual?"
4430,"Well, yeah, I mean yesterday I, or, yeah, I had a bit more to drink than, uh, usual, more alcohol I mean. So, I mean, could that have something to do with it? I'm not sure.","It could potentially. Did you, were you, were you drunk and did you pass out?"
4431,"Yeah, I think so. My, my friends, uh yeah, that's what my friends were, were saying anyway.","OK, and uh, talking about alcohol, how much do you usually drink?"
4432,"I usually, like, like four to six beers a day, but uh, yeah, yesterday was certainly more than that.",Have you considered reducing the amount of alcohol you drink? Has it affected you in any way?
4433,"I mean I, I'm retired now so, uhm, I don't know, I, I feel like it's been fine maybe, uh, I feel like it's been fine.","OK, OK, I suppose we could talk a little bit more about that later if you want uhm, as four to six beers is quite a lot actually, and it can affect your health in certain ways, but we can, we can chat more about that later."
4434,OK.,"And, uh, do you smoke?"
4435,"Yeah, I smoke, uhm, a half a pack of cigarettes per day. It was well over a pack before, so I've cut down a little bit.","No, that's great. OK, do you plan on cutting it down further or do you wanna stay right there?"
4436,"Yeah I have been, have been trying, just too, too darn expensive these days, so, been trying to cut back.","Yeah, yeah, that's fair, alright. What about marijuana? Do you consume marijuana?"
4437,"No, I don't.",Any recreational drugs?
4438,Nope.,"Alright, do you have any family history of any medical problems?"
4439,"Uh yeah, my, my father had, uh, he ended up having liver disease actually, he passed away from that I think. And he had heart problems too. He was a lifelong smoker and didn't really, didn't really take care of himself.","Hmm, I see. Do you, do you have a family doctor?"
4440,"Uh, I do. I haven't seen my family doctor in a number of years now though.","Yeah, well, you know it's, it's a good idea to see your family doctor on a regular basis, specially when you're getting older, because sometimes you might need changes in your medications, or there might be checkups or screenings that they might want to do. It's for your own benefit, you know, maybe even just seeing them once a year would be a good idea. I would definitely recommend that you book an appointment with them just for a checkup in the next couple of weeks. Is there a reason why you don't see your family doctor too often?"
4441,"I just haven't been, uhm, sick and I've been able to, to refill my prescriptions, mostly from just calling in, so.","OK, ok, I see, uhm, alright, and do you live alone or do you live with other people?"
4442,"Yeah, I live with my wife.","OK, alright, and are you able to take care of things like groceries or finances, or shoveling snow or cleaning the house, or do you need any assistance with those sort of household activities?"
4443,"Yeah, we moved, uhm, actually into an apartment last year. It's made it a lot easier in terms of the housework and that sort of thing. But I've been able to, uhm, I do the the grocery shopping and share the the chores around, around the house. I do, I'll use a cane sometimes. I, I injured my knee a number of years ago, but other than that, things are OK.","OK, OK, good to hear. That reminds me, have you had any surgeries in the past?"
4444,"Just on my, my left knee. I had a left knee replacement a few years ago.","OK alright and have you any had, had any hospitalizations?"
4445,No.,"OK, alright, uhm, so sounds like you've had a day of this wet cough with the, this, a bad smelling sort of sputum that's, that's yellowish green in color, and you've also had difficulties breathing for the past twelve hours, uh, so much so that you can't even go out to get mail and your hearts been racing. It's possible that while you were drunk that you might have, and given that you have acid reflux, that you might have accidentally have something go inside your breathing tube from, from your mouth or something that came up from your stomach and sometimes when that happens, food items can or other things can get lodged in your lungs and can become, uhm, can attract bacteria to, uh, to replicate and cause a bacterial infection, so it's possible that, that's what happened But it could also be a viral pneumonia or a viral infection in your chest. we'll get a chest x-ray done, we'll have some labs done as well, and we'll likely start some antibiotics. Have you recently been on any antibiotics?"
4446,"No, I haven't.","And you don't have any allergies to any, correct?"
4447,Correct.,"Alright, OK, we'll also do a physical exam just to give a listen to your, to your lungs and see how they're doing and then go from there. Do you have any questions for me?"
4448,"I've, uh, had a runny nose over the last few days and I've started to have a sore throat as well.","Hmm, Uhm, when did this start?"
4449,"I would, so the runny nose started, uh, about five days ago and, and the sore throat, uhm, about the same.","OK. Have you, uh, with the, the runny nose, do you have any, what's the discharge like?"
4450,"Uh, it's been kind of watery, it's clear.",OK. Alright and has your sore throat gotten better or worse over the past five days?
4451,"Uh, it did get a little bit worse initially and since then it's been kind of stable.","Have you, uhm, had any difficulties swallowing?"
4452,"No, it, it is a bit sore, uhm, to swallow so it takes me a little bit longer to eat, but I've been able to still, still eat.","Have you changed, noticed any changes in your voice? Any hoarseness in your voice?"
4453,No.,"No, OK. And do you have any nasal congestion? Does your nose feel stuffy?"
4454,"Yeah it does, yes.","OK, uhm, any fevers or chills?"
4455,"No, I don't think so.",OK. Any difficulties breathing?
4456,No.,Any cough?
4457,No.,"OK, uhm any, uh, pain in your chest?"
4458,No.,"Any other symptoms, anything related to your belly,  say, diarrhea or Constipation or any changes in your urinary, any urinary symptoms?"
4459,"No, nothing like that.","OK, OK, are you feeling fatigued, tired? Have any muscle aches?"
4460,"I, I have felt a little bit more drowsy these last few days and, uhm, yeah my, uhm, I have had some muscle aches as well.","Have you taken anything to help yourself, anything over the counter or any pills?"
4461,"I did use, uh, some uhm, like cold medication to help because I was having a headache as well and a lot of I guess just like pressure from the nose stuffiness.",Did the cold meds help?
4462,"Yeah, it did help a little bit, it did help my nose clear up but it came right back after a few hours.",And how's your headache now?
4463,"It's not too bad. It's pretty mild, but it's there.","Uhm, do you usually get headaches of this sort, or is this very different from what you generally experience, if you usually have headaches."
4464,"I don't usually get headaches, but I have felt uhm, a headache like this before though.","Oh OK, when was that?"
4465,"Maybe the last time I was, I was sick.",Sure.
4466,"Or if I don't get a good night's sleep. School's pretty early in the morning, so sometimes if I'm not sleeping well.","I see. OK alright, any other symptoms that you've experienced over the past five days that I didn't ask you about?"
4467,"No, it's been, yeah mostly the runny nose and sore throat and headache.","I see. OK, alright, and do you have any medical conditions?"
4468,"No, I've been healthy.","All right, good, any medications that you take on a regular basis?"
4469,"Uh, I'll use like Reactine or Claritin sometimes for allergies, but that's it.",What allergies do you have?
4470,"I have allergies to dust and some environmental things, like pollen or ragweed I think maybe.","I see. Alright, and, uhm, do you have any family history of any medical conditions?"
4471,"Uh, I think my dad has high blood pressure. He takes a medication for that, uhm nothing serious though that I know of.","OK, alright, and who do you currently live with?"

4476,No.,And have you recently traveled anywhere?
4477,"No, we've been doing classes virtually.",And any contact with anyone who you think might be sick.
4478,No.,"OK alright, well sounds like you have a sore throat and runny nose. You've been a little bit drowsy, had some headaches in the past five days, things were getting a little bit worse early on, but it's been a little bit, it's been more stable now. We'll do a physical exam, see, just listen to your chest, have a look inside your mouth and check your temperature and go from there. It sounds like you probably have a viral infection of some sort that should get, hopefully get better over time. We will also get a covid swab done just in case and if things seem to get worse, we can, you can definitely come back."
4479,"I've had, uh, worsening, uhm, shortness of breath, uhm, for the past couple of days.","OK, and, this has just been getting worse over the last couple of days?"
4480,Yeah.,"OK, how far are you able to walk before getting shorter breath?"
4481,"A couple of stairs, two to three stairs.","OK, and how far were you able, to, to walk before that?"
4482,"Hmm, I'd say about ten or eleven stairs.","OK, and have you had shortness of breath like this before?"

4484,"Yeah, yeah, I was feeling all, I was feeling, just like this was feeling awful. I went to the hospital. They started me on a water pill, kept me for a couple of days and then sent me back home. Uhm, they changed some of my meds, I think, increased the dose of something and yeah that's what happened.","OK, I see and have you been having, uhm, any swelling?"
4485,"Yeah, Oh my goodness, it's so bad I couldn't wear my shoes this morning. It's gotten worse over the past, one month.","Have you, have you had any changes to your weight?"
4486,"Yep, gained five pounds in the past two months.","And have you had any changes to your appetite or, or diet or exercise?"
4487,I can barely exercise. I feel so short of breath. My dad's the same.,"OK, uhm, and have you had any, uh, instances where you've woke up in the middle of the night extremely short of breath?"

Uhm, I also I brought the list of prescriptions, I can give that to you.","For sure, yeah I could go through, go through that, uhm here, uhm so, but first, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?"
4503,"Yeah, I have uh, heart, heart failure and uh, had two heart attacks and have high cholesterol, high blood pressure and, uh, I'm also overweight.","OK, do you know what your BMI is currently?"
4504,What's that?,"So this is a measure of body mass index and, uhm, can help give an indication about weight ranges, uhm, whether, uhm, being in a healthy weight range or, uhm, a weight range that's associated with, uhm, risk of certain diseases such as high blood pressure."

4510,"No, I haven't had chest pain. I have a, uhm, a heart doctor who, uhm, I went to see after the last hospitalization six months ago. Things were looking OK at the time. He ordered a bunch of tests. I Haven't done all of them yet.","OK, do you know, uh, by any chance, what the, uh, last ejection fraction was on your echocardiogram?"
4511,"I don't know, I, I don't know all of that. I don't know, you have to ask my daughter, she knows much more about me.","Yeah, no problem, well, we could look into, uh, some of those old, uh, older tests that you've done. OK, and, uhm, so can you tell me a little bit about your living situation currently? You mentioned your, your daughter, are you living with your daughter?"
4512,"Yeah, I live with my daughter. My husband passed away, uh, three years ago, and so I've just been staying with my daughter. It's just the two of us now.","I see, I'm sorry to hear that about your husband. Uhm, are you currently, uh, like functioning independently around the home, or does your daughter help with a lot of the tasks?"
4513,"Oh, she, she, she has to help me out, uhm she has to help me out. I uhm, I sometimes need help with the showering, simply because I get really short of breath and then, so I have to stop and it's just, she's just worried that it's unsafe, so she helps me out with that. Uhm, she gets most of the things done at home. She does the groceries and everything.","OK, I see, and do you, do you smoke cigarettes?"
4514,"I, I don't.","And, do you drink alcohol?"

4519,No.,"With others recently? OK, have you, so you haven't traveled anywhere?"
4520,No.,"Alright, uh, and uh, and in terms of family history, has anybody had any heart or lung conditions?"
4521,"Oh yeah, everyone in my family has high blood pressure. My mom had a heart attack. My brother had a heart attack. My sister had a heart attack. Everyone, everyone has heart problems.","OK, certainly sounds like something, uh, common in the family. Has there been any other, uh, conditions that run in the family?"
4522,No.,"Alright, uhm, I, I don't, I don't think I asked. Have you had any fevers or chills?"
4523,No.,"OK and or, or any night sweats?"
4524,No,"OK, and, uh, I might have asked, but just to, to be complete, did you have any nausea or vomiting?"
4525,No.,"OK, uhm, so were there any other symptoms or anything else that, that I may have forgot to ask about?"
4526,"No, I don't think so. It's just the, the difficulties with breathing and the swelling.","Yeah, so the first thing, I'll speak to your daughter and we will, uhm, get a look at some of the old or some of the reports from, uhm, over the last several months from, and from the cardiologist you see. But it's, uh, and then, uh, also we'll get some blood work and a chest x-ray. But it is sounding like this could be a heart failure exacerbation. Which, so some of the shortness of breath, it could be coming from fluid, uhm, that has accumulated in your lungs and so, uh, we'll give you, oh, another type of water pill now, Furosemide, to try and help get rid of some of that fluid so it will help with the breathing. And in the meantime, we'll wait for the investigations to come back."
4527,"Uh, I have just been feeling very short of breath recently.",OK.
4528,"And I thought I should come in. I've also had a, I've also had a cough.","I see. OK, uhm, and when does this shortness of breath, uhm, come on? How, how much activity are you able to do?"
4529,"Uhm, I can walk a block.",OK.
4530,Without being short of breath.,"And prior to this change, how far were you able to walk and and how long ago did you, did you notice this change?"
4531,"Uhm, I, I guess I could walk, uh, I don't know, it's been very, I guess it's, it's been a gradual change. Uhm, maybe a month, a month ago I felt that I couldn't really walk as much as I used to, and then it's only gotten worse. Two or three months ago I could, I could walk a kilometre or two, or more.","OK, so quite a significant change over the last little while. Have you had any episodes where you wake up in the middle of the night with, with shortness of breath, and you need to sit up?"
4532,No.,"OK, and how many pillows do you sleep with?"
4533,One.,OK and have you noticed any like ankle swelling or or leg swelling?
4534,No.,OK. And you mentioned cough. When did that start?
4535,"I've had a cough for a while, the past five, ten years, but I feel that it's been a little bit more frequent now. It's just, I just get into this coughing fit and I think there was a time when I had a little bit of blood come out as well, once or twice. The coughing also makes it difficult for me to breathe, you know, I feel very short of breath after that.","Yeah, certainly, uhm, how much blood have you coughed up?"
4536,"Oh, I don't know. I think it was it was a little bit.","Did it happen each time, or has it only been a couple of times?"
4537,"I think maybe, two or three times but then there have also been times when I cough up this, this stuff that I cough up is a little bit pink in color. It's not exactly blood, but it's, it's, you know, pinkish.","OK, and are you producing sputum each time you're coughing up?"
4538,"Most of the times, yes.","OK, is this a change from previously? Did you have a dry cough before?"
4539,"A bit more of a dry cough before, but I mean, so sometimes it will be a dry cough sometimes, uh, it was more of a wet cough, but it was, it was usually just this white thing coming up. It wasn't like, there was never blood before.","OK, and you're coughing more often as well over this last month?"
4540,"Oh yeah, Oh yeah,","OK. Have you been experiencing any, any headaches?"
4541,No.,"OK, how about any eye pain or ear pain?"

4552,"Yeah, yeah I was, uhm, 210 pounds.","OK, uhm, so yeah, about a 10% reduction in your weight over the last couple of months, it sounds like. OK, How is your appetite been?"
4553,"Uh, it's OK.","Alright, and have you been having any chest pain?"
4554,No.,"Any, any wheeze?"

I'm trying to, I'm trying to quit, but it's hard.","Yeah, for sure it's great that you're working towards quitting. We can discuss that further and there are several options that might be available to help if it's something you're interested in, because yeah, it's definitely really hard. Are you, do you drink alcohol?"
4572,"Uh, once in a while, on Christmas.","OK, and do you use any recreational drugs?"

4577,"And uh, yeah, my, my son comes over and helps out with groceries and my wife cooks but, I, I help her with cleaning sometimes.","OK, great and, so are you retired?"
4578,yep.,"OK, uhm, and has anybody in the family had any heart or lung conditions?"
4579,"My dad died of lung cancer. He was a, he was a big smoker as well. And my mom had a heart attack.","OK, and how old were your parents approximately?"
4580,"Yeah, my dad was 65 and my mom was, was very young, she was 50.",I see. Did your mom survive the heart attack?
4581,"No, no she did not.","Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Uhm, and the lung cancer you mention, any other cancers that run in the family?"
4582,No.,"OK, so that was all the questions I wanted to ask on on history. Uhm certainly it sounds like you're bringing up some blood with, with, with the increased cough and with difficulties breathing so we will get a, uhm, a chest x-ray and possibly a CT image of your chest as well to see if there's anything going on in your lungs and we might do some blood work as well to check a few things so uhm, we'll get those ordered and, and see what, see what that shows."
4583,"Hi, I'm, I'm the mom of the patient and I just wanted to talk to you about the, just about Thomas here. He's just been not, he's just not been feeling well. He's had this cough for the past three or four days. And he's also had this stuffy nose, and this, this watery discharge. Yeah, he's just not feeling good.","OK, I see and so the, the cough you said started three or four days ago. Has the cough gotten any better or any, stayed the same or gotten worse?"
4584,"Gotten a bit worse, I would say.",Is he bringing up any sputum?
4585,No.,So has there been any blood?
4586,No no.,"OK, and has the cough interfered with sleep?"
4587,"Yeah, his cough is usually worse, uhm, at night.",OK. And you say that he's also had a runny nose. What does the discharge look like?
4588,"It's just, uh, it's watery.",And this started three or four days ago as well?
4589,"A little, a little after the, uhm, yeah actually, around the same time, around the same time, yeah.","OK. Has he had any, uhm, like difficulties breathing, like saying that he feels one of the, like the nostrils obstructed?"
4590,"Hmmm, he hasn't, well, he's just been breathing with his mouth open, so that's what he does at night as well. He also has this nasal voice right now, probably because it's, it's, you know, he has this stuffy nose. But he hasn't really complained about it.","Yeah, has he had any pain, like facial pain?"
4591,"Uhm, no, not really.","OK, how about any changes to smell or loss of smell?"
4592,"Yeah, I don't think he can smell much right now.","OK, and uh, did those, did that start a few days ago as well?"
4593,"Yeah, yeah, since he's been complaining of his stuffy nose.","OK, and has he had any headaches?"
4594,"No, but he has had a fever.","OK. How, did you check it?"
4595,"Yeah, I did, I did. It was uh, 39 last night.","Alright, it's certainly a fever. Uhm,  has he had any chills or night sweats?"
4596,"Yeah, he's, but he's been feeling pretty chilly.",OK.
4597,"Yeah, he's wearing a couple, a couple of layers at home, still feels chilly, and yeah, he has alot of chills and definitely has a fever.","Alright, and has the fever been there the whole whole time, if you're aware or has that kind of come and gone?"
4598,"Uhm, you know what, I actually just checked yesterday so I don't know.","Alright, has he had a sore throat?"
4599,"Yeah, it's usually worse in the morning. I think it's more of a, I guess the post nasal drip you know with the, with a runny nose. It's just, It's pretty bad in the morning.","OK, has he had any red eyes or, or eye discharge or eye pain?"
4600,No no no.,"OK, and has he had any shortness of breath?"
4601,No.,How about any wheezing?
4602,No.,Any chest pain?
4603,No.,"Any lightheadedness, dizziness or fainting?"
4604,No.,"OK, and does he mention anything about feeling as though his heart's racing?"

4606,No.,Any nausea or vomiting?
4607,No.,Any diarrhea or Constipation?
4608,No.,"How about any urinary problems like pain or, or frequency?"
4609,"No, nothing like that. He hasn't complained of anything like that.",Has he had any skin changes or rashes?
4610,No.,And how about any muscle aches or joint pains?
4611,"Yeah, yeah he definitely has that. He's complaining a lot about muscle aches.","OK, and how has his energy been? Has he been fatigued?"
4612,"Oh yeah. He hasn't gone out to play. He hasn't done anything, he's just been lying in bed.","OK, and over the last several months has he had any weight loss?"
4613,No. He's been gaining weight actually.,"OK, no that's good. Certainly yeah, at the age of 11 should be still gaining weight, so that's good. And has he been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?"
4614,"Yeah, he was diagnosed with uh, cystic fibrosis when he was a, he was a child, four years old.","OK, and, uh, is he on, uh, like any medications for that?"
4615,"He's on, he was on an antibiotic until the age of five. Uh, that he had to take on regular basis, but he is, he's not really on any medications right now. I know that there are a couple of new ones that are out there, but those are very expensive.","OK, and has he had any exacerbations or hospitalizations?"
4616,"uh, yeah, he's he's had about, uh, one hospitalization every two years?","Alright, and is he followed by a respirologist, currently?"
4617,"Yes, yes, yes.","OK, uhm and has there been, like an increase in the sputum production or like worsening shortness of breath over these last few days?"
4618,"No, not really.",OK. And has he had any surgeries?
4619,No.,Does he have any allergies to medications?
4620,"Uhm, Sulfa drugs.",And the reaction is?
4621,"Uhm, he just gets a rash.","OK is it, are immunizations up to date?"
4622,"Oh yeah, yeah, we're very careful about that given his diagnosis. He's got all the, all the vaccines.","That's great, that's really important for sure, uhm, and so I just wanted to ask about life at home a little bit. So who's in the house and who's the primary caregiver for him?"
4623,"I'm the primary caregiver, its just, uh, me, him and my husband.","OK, and uh, is he, uh, what grade is he in right now?"
4624,He's in grade six?,"OK, how is school going?"
4625,"Schools going well, it's just the, yeah, the hospitalizations can sometimes be disruptive, but it's going well. He's, he's getting B's in his class. He's doing well, he's got a good group of friends.","Excellent and have you had any concerns about about development or, or his growth?"
4626,"Uhm, no.","OK, so meeting all milestones and?"
4627,Yeah.,"OK. And in regards to, uhm, birth history, were there any complications throughout pregnancy or, or at birth?"
4628,"Uhm, no, nothing at birth or during pregnancy, but he did start having lots of respiratory infections, which is when the pediatrician did that test. I forget the name, for the test and then they were, uhm, the, uhm, he was found to have, CF.","OK, uhm, and does anybody in the home smoke?"
4629,No.,Or drink alcohol?
4630,no.,"OK, uhm, and are there any pets in the home?"
4631,No.,"OK, has he been around anybody who's been sick?"
4632,"I don't, I don't think so.","OK, and, uh, have you guys traveled anywhere?"
4633,"No, just been at home.","OK, uhm, and has anybody in the, else in the family have cystic fibrosis?"
4634,"No, no, no, no one else does. But we got tested and we were both found, my, my husband and I were found out have the gene for it. We were carriers.","OK, uhm, I see. And any, any heart conditions or, or other lung conditions that run in the family?"
4635,"No, nothing else.","OK. And were there any other symptoms that, or anything else that you wanted to tell me that maybe I forgot to ask about?"
4636,"Uhm, no, I was just, uh, I'm just worried about him, uhm about his fever specifically, it's been high and I know that usually when he has these hospitalizations, he presents pretty similarly. So just wondering if he would need to be hospitalized again and if he needs antibiotics.","Yeah, for sure it's, it's been uhm, so it's been three or four days, but with a fever this high and his symptoms, with uh, having obstruction, discharge, uhm, changes to smell or loss of smell it does sound like it could be bacterial and so I think it would be reasonable to possibly to start antibiotics in this case, but we'll go through, through a physical exam, check some vitals and go from there."
4637,"So, I just came in here because for the last day I've been just getting shortness of breath. I recently, yesterday actually, was just busy at home, cleaning out my basement. And, like that was yesterday afternoon, I did that for a couple hours and then at night I just started to get the shortness of breath. It's continued until today. I'm also getting some wheezing and tightness in my chest as well as some cough. So yeah, that's all just been happening over the last day.","OK, and uh, is the shortness of breath here now? is it, is at rest? Or are you having that when you're exerting yourself?"
4638,"No, it's more so just the tightness. I wouldn't call it pain, but I do still have a little bit of wheezing.",OK.
4639,"So yeah, that's, that's that.","And you mentioned a cough as well. With the cough is it, has it been dry, or have you been bringing up sputum?"
4640,"Uhm, it was, it was mainly dry yesterday, like, like the cough has kind of gone away, but yesterday night I was coughing a lot and it was mostly dry.","OK, have you brought up any blood?"
4641,No.,"OK, and have you had any infectious symptoms like, eye tearing or red eyes, maybe a runny nose or sore throat?"
4642,"Uhm, not a sore throat, but it does feel like it, it's kind of like just constricted in there like, uhm, I don't know if it's relevant, but I, I do have asthma. Uh, like I was diagnosed ten years ago, but it's been pretty stable, like it's, like just right now. I haven't had shortness of breath for a pretty long time.","OK, uh, and, uh, we'll get back to the past medical history shortly, I just wanted to ask a few more symptoms, but certainly could be relevant today. Uhm, so uhm, so you mentioned that you have had some throat tightness. Have you had any loss of smell or, or loss of taste?"
4643,"No, nothing like that.","OK, and have you had any fevers or chills?"
4644,No.,"OK, have you had any nausea or vomiting?"
4645,"No, no nausea or vomitting.","How about, any diarrhea or Constipation?"
4646,No.,And have you had any urinary problems like painful or frequency?
4647,No.,OK and have you had any night sweats over the last several weeks to months?
4648,"No, nothing like that.","And, uhm, have you had any weight changes over the last little while?"
4649,No.,OK. And have you noticed any skin changes or rashes?
4650,"Uh, no, I, I do have just like the general, like, eczema, that I use a cream for, but that's just normal for me.","OK. And any muscle aches or, or joint pains?"
4651,No.,Have you had any fatigue?
4652,No.,"OK, alright you mentioned asthma as part of your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?"
4653,"No, it's just asthma and it was diagnosed, I think when I was like, probably 11 or 12 years old.","OK, and do you use inhalers for that?"
4654,"Yeah, I have two inhalers, uh, like one, one is like a blue one, one is like an, like an orange one, uh, it's, so I think it's one of them is just like, I take whenever I really need to and the other one I take every day. Uhm, and I haven't been taking the one, uh, I think it's called Ventolin. But I took it like, uh, had to take it like three or four times last night and like, throughout the day yesterday. And it, it did help, but it didn't really relieve some of my symptoms.","OK, and prior to that, how often have you been using, uhm, the blue one."
4655,"The blue one before yesterday, probably the last time I used it was probably like a month ago.","OK, so you don't need it that that often then?"
4656,No.,"Do you have any triggers for asthma that you're aware of, like exercising or going out into the cold or even like allergies like dust or, or, or pollen?"
4657,"Uhm, I do have allergies in the spring. I think it's to pollen and in the winter, it does, like my symptoms do get a bit worse and I have to use the ventil more. But recently for the last few months at least, it's been pretty stable. I haven't really had to use, use it too much.","OK, and, and do you use any other medications?"
4658,"Uh, just when I have allergies. I, I just use over the counter allergy meds.","OK, and you use a cream for, for your skin too like, yeah?"
4659,"Yeah, I use, like it's, it's, I think it's like a mixture of like a steroid cream.","OK, and do you have any allergies to medications?"
4660,Not that I know of.,"OK, and are your immunizations up to date?"
4661,Yeah.,"Alright, and right now, who are you living with, and whereabouts are you living?"
4662,"Yeah, so I'm just living with a couple roommates. I just go to college and I'm living with three other roommates.","OK, and has anybody been sick?"
4663,"Uhm, I decided, like, I, yesterday I went home like, to my parents house and helped my dad, that's where I was cleaning the basement. But besides that, that was, that was uh, that was it?","OK, and  sorry, just had to backtrack a little bit. Have you had any hospitalizations, either due to asthma or for any other reason?"
4664,"Uhm, I think when I was 15, I, I had to go to the emergency department, but I, I wasn't hospitalized.","OK, and was this, uh, did you have similar symptoms at that time?"
4665,"Yeah, it was, uh, it was for asthma and like, uh, that time it was definitely much much worse and I remember like I was breathing a lot, uh, the shortness of breath was really bad and the ventolin like puffers weren't even helping me at that time.","OK yeah, OK, and have you had any surgeries before?"
4666,No.,"Alright, so yeah, you mentioned that you're, you're cleaning up the basement yesterday? Was there a lot of dust down there or anything like that, that might have triggered it?"
4667,"Yeah, we were like just moving boxes. There were books here and there that definitely there would have been dust. I should have been more careful, like wore a mask, but I didn't think about it at that time.","OK yeah for sure, uh, and do you smoke cigarettes?"
4668,"No, like I can't even stand cigarette smoke.","OK, that's good. And do you smoke marijuana or use any cannabis products?"
4669,"Uh, no if I, if I really want marijuana, I would have to go with edibles, I, I can't take the smoke.","OK, I see and, do you drink alcohol?"
4670,"Uh just, I would say probably on the weekends I might have four or five beers.","OK, and, anybody else in the family have asthma or skin irritation like, like you have?"
4671,"Yeah so my, my older sister actually also was diagnosed with asthma. She also has the eczema that I have and my mom was also diagnosed with asthma when she was a child, but she's been completely fine since then.","OK, well that's good that, that she's been OK. Does anybody in the family have any heart or, or lung conditions or any cancers that run in the family?"
4672,"My grandfather died of lung cancer, but he was just, just smoked all throughout his life.","OK, uhm, alright, so that was all of the questions that I wanted to ask today. So the next part we'll go on to do a physical exam, but did you have any thing else that maybe I forgot to ask about today?"
4673,"Uh, no, I, I, I think I know what this was caused by, but yeah, let's, let's see. Thanks for your help.","Oh you're welcome, so yeah, we'll, we'll, uhm,trial some more puffers and see what we could do, cause certainly it's sounding like an asthma exacerbation, and so definitely let somebody know if your, your breathing is getting more difficult."
4674,"So yeah I've been having for the last two days, uh, it just started randomly. I had to miss work, Just a headache started at the beginning and then I noticed the same day, so this was two days ago. A headache started and my body just started aching throughout the day and yesterday I just developed, I think it was a fever, I didn't really get a chance to check, like, but I was very chilly yesterday and now I have this cough as well.","OK, so just to confirm, so the, the symptoms at first started with a headache and, and fatigue, and that started two days ago?"
4675,"Yeah, like with fatigue, like also just the, my muscles were aching.","OK, and any particular muscles that were achy or is this more of a, uhm, general kind of whole body feeling?"
4676,Just a general whole body feeling.,"OK. Uh, and in terms of the headache, could you describe, uhm, could you describe the headache?"
4677,"Yes, it's just kind of like at the front like near my forehead, on, on kind of like both sides more. It just feels like, like pressure in there.","OK, have you had headaches like this before?"
4678,"Uh, no, not really.","OK. Uhm, is the headache on one side or, or the other or on both sides?"
4679,I think it's like both sides.,"And is the headache like pulsating or is it more, continuous kind of constant pain?"
4680,I think it's more continuous constant.,"Alright, and have you had any sensitivity to light or sound that, that's made the headache a lot worse?"
4681,"No, it's, it's kind of just there, it's about the same as when it was when it started.","OK, have you had any nausea and vomiting associated with that, the headache or anything else?"
4682,"Uh, no.","OK. And so, and then, last question for the headache piece. Does it feel like it was a like kind of sudden onset, worst headache of your life sensation?"
4683,"Uh, no, it's still like, like I can still cope with it, like, if I wanted to I would have gone into work. But it was the muscle aches that really started bothering me.","OK. And so you had a cough as well, when did this start, and is it a dry or wet cough?"
4684,"It's a dry cough and it started yesterday, probably in the morning when I woke up.","OK, and has the cough been getting any better or worse?"
4685,"Uhm, since yesterday I would sayit's probably a bit worse now.","Alright, and it's dry, but have you seen any blood that's come up?"
4686,"No, no, no blood.",And have you had any shortness of breath?

4700,Yesterday I felt a bit drained. I just kind of like stayed in bed the whole day.,"OK, and have you tried any medications for the, for the headache or any of your symptoms so far?"
4701,"I, I took a Tylenol. I actually took a couple Tylenols, uh, when the headache and pain started. It did help a bit for a couple hours, but it just kind of came back.","OK. And in the past, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?"
4702,"Uhm, Just uh, like I had type 2 diabetes, that's it.","OK, and are you using medications for your diabetes?"
4703,"Yeah, I've been on Metformin.","OK, have you used insulin before?"
4704,"No, no, I've never had to use insulin. It's pretty stable, like my family doctors even considering taking me off the metformin.","OK, no, that's great. And that reminds me, actually, how has your weight been over the last several months? Have you had any weight changes?"
4705,"Not really, like I, I, I think over the last two years I've just been very focused on my fitness, so I feel like I've probably lost around 30 pounds over the last year. Last one to two, yeah, year, but like I, I've been exercising a lot like uhm, gym every day, it's, it's been, it's been a journey.","no that's great though, good for you.

4711,"Yeah, it's just us three.","OK, and uh, any exposures to, to anybody who's been sick, either at home or at work or, or any other activities?"
4712,"Uh, unfortunately I do have to, uh, I'm one of the unlucky ones that still has to go into work. And yeah, it's it's hard to say like at work, there are times when we, like at lunch we eat like without a mask. I don't know if, I didn't notice anyone having any symptoms, but like, I don't know if someone, you know, who knows where anyone has been.","Yeah, so nobody that you're aware of who's been sick though?"
4713,No.,And everybody at home has been OK?
4714,"Yeah, at home everyone's good. I kind of just distance myself into like one room.",Mhm.
4715,Just in case anything goes wrong.,OK. And have you traveled anywhere?
4716,"No, we've been, we've been at home this whole time.",OK. And do you smoke cigarettes?
4717,"No, I've never smoked.","OK, so do you, do you smoke marijuana?"
4718,No.,"Alright and you use any other recreational drugs like cocaine, opioids, heroin? And how, have you used anything like that in the past?"
4719,No. Never.,"OK, uhm, and do you drink alcohol?"
4720,"Yeah, well just occasionally, like I would say maybe, maybe some wine, once, uh, like once every couple days. Maybe a beer on the weekend, but that's it.","Alright. So I think that was all I wanted to ask on history today. Was there anything else that, that you wanted to add before we go on to the exam and?"
4721,"Yeah, so I, I, I don't know if I should get a test done, like for covid. Uhm yeah, that's all, just wondering if I, if I can do that here?","Yeah, so that is something that that is on the differential for what could be causing your symptoms, especially with uhm, starting at having a cough and the nonspecific viral type symptoms with the cough, headache, muscle aches, so certainly could be caused by covid, but there are other reasons for, that could explain these symptoms, such as other types of viral illnesses, and so we will do a PCR swab today, as well as do, well, check your vitals to see if you have a fever now and we'll also maybe send an influenza swab as well, and and do some blood work. But in the meantime, since we're running the covid swab, it will be important to self isolate for the next 14 days and we will let you know what the test results show. But despite, even if they are negative, it will be important to still stay self isolating for the next 14 days."
4722,"OK, I'll do that. That sounds good.","Alright, thank you."
4723,"Umm, yeah so I just came in today with, I've been having a few symptoms for the last I would say 5 days. So I've had, it started with a sore throat just five days ago, kind of just very irritating sore throat sensation that's kind of gotten worse over the last few days. And then I started getting a fever four days ago and it has been going on for the last couple of days as well. And the highest temperature I measured on myself was 38.8 degrees Celsius and yeah, so that, that's, that's my main concern right now.","OK and, since the sore throat started 5 days ago has it been getting better, worse or staying the same?"
4724,"I would say it's getting worse. I have some pain with swallowing food as well as, like now, even when I'm talking a little, I'm getting some pain as well.","OK, have you been able to maintain your appetite?"
4725,I do feel like I've lost a bit of my appetite over the last three to four days.,"OK, and have you noticed any changes to your voice?"
4726,"Uhm, I don't think so, not yet, I, but I think, like the way it's hurting right now, I feel like it's coming.","Alright, so have you notice any like neck swelling?"
4727,"Yeah, now that you mention it, I, I do have like these two lumps on the right side of my neck, like kind of right below the jaw.",OK. Are they painful?
4728,"Uhm, not, not really. Like when I'm pressing on them they don't really hurt, but I definitely have two lumps.","I see, OK. We'll, certainly look into that on the physical exam. OK, and uh, and you mentioned that you've also been really tired over these last few days?"
4729,"Yeah, I've, I haven't really had much of an appetite, kind of just, I've skipped work, just trying to take it easy like just napping the whole day, as much as I can.","OK, and so you've been experiencing fatigue. Have you had any, any headaches?"
4730,"No headaches, no.","Alright, how about any eye redness or runny nose, or?"
4731,"Uh no, no runny nose, or, so I, I don't have headaches, but I, I, I think I was having some body aches just yesterday.","OK, so any particular area that, that's aching?"
4732,"Uhm, not really. It's kind of just like a general, like I don't know if it was, it was because I was lying around the whole day, but just kind of a general pain throughout the body.","OK. And have you been experiencing any difficulties, or sorry, have you been experiencing any cough?"
4733,"No, not really.","OK, how about any shortness of breath or trouble breathing?"
4734,No.,"OK, have you had any wheezing?"
4735,No wheezing.,"Alright, and how about any chest pain?"
4736,"No, no, no chest pain.","Have you had any heart palpitations or, or feeling like your heart's racing?"
4737,No.,"OK, uhm, and, maybe you had any lightheadedness or, or dizziness?"
4738,"Uh, no, not really.",Have you had any abdominal pain?
4739,"Uhm, actually, yeah, yesterday when I was, uhm, like when I was having the body pain, I also noticed a little bit of abdominal pain just, like on the upper, I would say upper left side.","OK, and, and how would you describe this pain and how long has it been going on for?"
4740,"Just since yesterday. It's, it's not really like, I would say it's more of a discomfort than a pain, but I definitely do feel like like something's just not right in that area.","I see, is there anything that you do that, that makes that, that feeling worse, or make, that make it better?"
4741,"Yeah, like I, I try not to lie on that side. I have to go on to the other side.","Alright, did you notice this in the last couple of days as well?"
4742,"Yeah, that, that just started yesterday.",OK. Have you had any nausea or vomiting?
4743,No.,How about any diarrhea?
4744,No.,"Alright, and have you had any fevers or, or sorry, yeah, you mentioned you had a fever of 38.2. And have you had any chills?"
4745,"Uhm, no chills, well, yeah, I would say a couple nights ago I might have had some chills, but mainly it's just been, I've been feeling more hot and I have been kind of getting like night sweats.","OK, you've been having night sweats this week or have they been going on longer?"
4746,"No, just, just this week.","Alright, have you had any changes to your weight over the last several months?"
4747,"No, it's been pretty steady.","Alright, and the fever this week, has it been there the whole time, or has it come and gone?"
4748,"It kind of comes and goes. I've probably taken temperatures like every day. But I would say it's definitely, for the last few days it's been more of a fever, like the nightsweats sensation. Before it was a bit fine, like, but the highest temperatures have been in the last few days.","OK, have you noticed any skin changes or rashes?"
4749,"Uhm, just like, I, I don't know, like I don't think there are any changes, but I did notice some, like kind of just pink, pink spots on my arm the other day.","OK, well uh, were they itchy?"
4750,"No, they weren't really itchy. Just like a couple I would say like raised, not raised spots, just like flat, kind of pinkish spots.","OK, and has that, has that spread anywhere or has it gone away?"
4751,"No, hasn't really started spreading yet, I just noticed it on, on my arm, and I, I don't think it has really spread at all.","OK, this is on, on one arm?"
4752,Yeah.,"OK. And you've had some body aches, uh, have you had any joint pains?"
4753,"No join pains, no.","OK, and are you currently sexually active?"
4754,Yes.,"Alright, and could you tell me a little bit about your partners or, or partner and I, and I was wondering if you use condoms?"
4755,"Yeah, so I, I just have one partner right now, my fiance, and we Uh, I actually like have in an IUD, so like we, we don't use condoms, but like we're pretty honest and safe with each other. I fully trust him, like he doesn't have any partners or anything like that and I only have, I don't have any other partners as well.","OK, have you had a sexually transmitted infection before?"
4756,"No, never.","OK, any concerns currently? Any vaginal discharge or itchiness or, or pain?"
4757,"No, nothing like that.","OK, and have you been pregnant before?"
4758,"No, I haven't no.",OK. And have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
4759,"Uhm, just uh, I have had just eczema in the past, but that, that's fairly stable. It's been treated, I don't really have it anymore.","OK, do you take any medications regularly?"
4760,"Currently, no, no.",Any allergies to medications?
4761,No.,"Alright, uhm, and any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?"
4762,No.,"OK. And could you tell me a little bit about your living situation currently, like, who you live with, and, and where?"
4763,"Yeah, so I'm just living with my fiance and that's, we're living in like a small apartment. And right now we're not really seeing anyone else really during the pandemic.","OK, so have you been around anybody who's been sick?"
4764,"I just had to go into work like one day last week just to grab some of my stuff, but didn't really come into contact with anyone. My fiance does go to his work like a couple, like three or four times during the week, so I don't know if he got into contact with anyone, It's, it's hard to say.","Has he been sick at all? Like any, any cough, sore throat, anything, like that?"
4765,"He did have a sore throat last week, but it kind of just went away on its own in a couple of days and compared to me, like, his was nothing really.","OK, uh. And have you traveled anywhere?"
4766,No.,And do you smoke cigarettes?
4767,No.,How about do you smoke marijuana or use any cannabis products?
4768,"Uh, probably smoke marijuana, just maybe once or twice a month.","OK, so it sounds like socially?"
4769,Yeah.,Do you use any other recreational drugs?
4770,"No, nothing else.",OK. And do you drink alcohol?
4771,"Yeah, I, Probably have some red wine every other day, I would say.","OK, and this is like one glass or two?"
4772,"Yeah, no, It's just like a normal glass of wine. Maybe, like we probably go through like a bottle between both of us, like every two weeks, maybe.","OK. And in the family, has there been anybody who's had any cancers?"
4773,"No, no, no cancer is in the family.","OK, how about any genetic diseases or anything congenital that runs in the family?"
4774,Not that I know of.,"OK. So that was everything that I wanted to ask about on history, and so next we'll go ahead and get vitals and do a physical exam. But did you have anything else that maybe I forgot to ask about, or any other symptoms maybe?"
4775,"No, I don't think so. Do you think it can be covid at all?","Uhm, so covid does present in a variety of non specific ways and so it certainly could be on the differential for causing a sore throat and abdominal pain and as well as a fever. However, it could be caused by other things as well. Uhm, currently your constellation of symptoms, with the enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, sore throat, it sounds like you may have uhm, an inflamed spleen as well, which could all be signs and symptoms of something called EBV or, or mono. And it sounds like you might have had an exposure, like your husband or fiance rather may have had this last week with the sore throat. All that being said, today we'll do the monospot test to check for that as well as some blood work. And we will do a covid swab as well, just in case."
4776,"OK, that sounds good. Thank you.",Thank you.
4777,"Hi, so yeah I I'm really worried. I started coughing up blood this morning, and for the last two days I've been having some, like on my right calf, just a lot of swelling and tenderness. Uhm, I just actually got out of the hospital just last week. I had a knee replacement surgery on my right leg. So yeah, I was just really concerned about this blood that I'm coughing up.","Yeah, certainly. So when, so you had a knee surgery last week, were you like immobilized afterwards for periods of time?"
4778,"eah, I've been just taking some rest, not really doing too much. And even in the hospital, like I was there for a day and was pretty immobilized.","OK, and have you had any pain in your calf, and if so, which which one?"
4779,It's just the right calf and it's it's pretty swollen right now and I was having a lot of pain over it for the last two days.,"OK is it, can you feel the pain at rest, or or is it with uh like with movement? Or if you press on it?"
4780,"It's yeah, it's pretty tender when I press on it. I haven't really been moving around, and it's still like painful right now, but it doesn't really hurt when I'm like, like I've been trying to keep myself rested just because of the surgery, but when I press on it, it is pretty tender.","OK, and is the is the swelling in kind of one spot of your leg, or is it most of the of the leg?"
4781,"It's just the calf, I would say more like just the lower leg area.","OK. Have you noticed any skin changes, like redness or or or temperature like it feels hot to touch."
4782,Maybe a little bit. I haven't really noticed it too much.,"OK, and do you have a history of like varicose veins or anything like that?"
4783,"No, nothing like that.",OK. So uhm when did the coughing up blood start?
4784,"Just this morning actually. So just uh, like I would say a couple hours ago.","OK, and how much blood are you coughing up?"
4785,"Just some on like I just notice on the tissue like just some spots that I noticed every time that I'm, like, I would have to cough it up. Maybe like in the last couple hours, I've had three episodes of that where I've noticed blood on the tissue.",I see and did you ever cough prior to this?
4786,"No, not really.","OK, uhm, and have you been experiencing any infectious symptoms like red or runny eyes, runny nose, sore throat?"
4787,"No, nothing like that.",Have you been having any chest pain or or shortness of breath?
4788,"No chest pain, but I do feel like I do have to take like a deeper breath. Like I've just been feeling it this morning a little bit. It's just kind of a bit of uneasy breathing.","OK, so it has been more difficult to breathe. And is that is that at rest as well, do you feel that kind of sensation?"
4789,"Yeah, even right now, just a little bit, like it's it's not anything that I'm too worried about, but it is there.","OK, do you have any pain if you have if if you take a deep breath in."
4790,"Uh, no I don't, no I don't really have any pain.","OK, and do you feel like your your heart's racing or beating really fast."
4791,"I I do feel like my heart is beating like faster, especially today. But yeah, I don't know.","Alright, and how about your breathing? Do you feel like you're breathing faster."

4804,Yeah.,"OK, and do you take any medications for the blood pressure and diabetes?"

4815,"I used to, but I quit when I was in my thirties. I used to smoke like probably a pack a day between my 20s and 30s.","OK, but it sounds like yeah, you quit, about 20 years ago then?"

4821,"Not that I know, not really.","OK. So that was everything that I wanted to ask about on history today. We'll do physical exam and I'll listen to your chest and have a look at your leg. We'll also order some imaging studies, with a CTPA it's called. Uh but before we go ahead with that, was there anything else that that you wanted to add?"
4822,"No, I think that's that's all.","OK, so we'll get the lab work started, as well as the imaging ordered. It will look for, to see if there is any pulmonary embolism present, because with the surgery last week and being immobilized for a period of time, it is a risk factor for it, and leg swelling with uhm coughing up blood can be symptoms of this. So we'll wanna make sure to to do, to investigate for a pulmonary embolism."
4823,"OK. Sounds good, thank you so much.","Sounds good, thank you."
4824,"I I've had this cough that's been ongoing and and getting worse, and and now I've been having this like sharp pain in my in my chest.","OK, and when did the cough first start?"
4825,"So yeah, like the cough started, uh, started maybe a couple of weeks ago.","A couple weeks ago, OK, and has it gotten worse since then, or has it stayed about the same?"
4826,"Uh it, it got worse initially, but it's been about the, uh, well, actually yeah, it's been getting worse 'cause now I've I've started to notice blood in the sputum that wasn't there at first.","OK, and when did you first notice that?"
4827,"So I, I first saw some blood, uhm, two days ago. It was a really small amount so I didn't worry too much, but I I brought up blood yesterday and again this morning. It's been just about enough to cover a tissue, so it's not a lot of blood each time, but it's pretty red.","OK, and before that were you getting any production throughout your coughs for the last few weeks, like were you producing any sputum?"
4828,"Uh, no.","No, OK. Can you just describe your cough currently? Is it more of a wet cough or dry cough?"
4829,"Uh it, yeah, it's it's dry mostly with the exception of bringing up some of the blood.","And is the blood just in like sputum that you're bringing up? Or are you coughing up blood into the tissue, for example?"
4830,"Blood is, I'm coughing that up into the tissue.","OK, and do you remember 2 weeks ago prior to that, were there any factors that might have caused this, like for example, did you travel anywhere or see or was in contact with anyone that was sick?"
4831,"No I haven't uh, traveled anywhere. I have been doing volunteering and and things at the homeless shelter here in in town. It's been really cold out.","OK, uh, and how long have you been volunteering there?"
4832,"Uh, I started this winter, so the last three, three or four months.","OK, and were you in contact with anyone there that was sick or was having similar symptoms at all?"
4833,"There are certainly some people around that that had some that would have a cough, or were not feeling very well but, uh, and sometimes I would see people who would even have a hospital gown on, that that that uh came from the hospital. So yeah, there were definitely some people who weren't feeling well.","OK, and do you know if anyone at the homeless shelter or anywhere else around your surrounding has had tuberculosis?"
4834,"No, not that I'm aware of. I haven't heard of that.","OK, are you having any other symptoms at all besides the the coughing and the blood, like coughing up blood as well?"
4835,"Yeah, I've been uh, starting to get like this sharp chest pain as well. I kind of feel it on the left sides and in center I guess kinda more so.","OK and your chest pain, when did that start?"
4836,"So, uh, this started, yeah, 'bout a few days ago as well. It's been within the last week.","OK, and uh, would you describe it as, so you said it's kind of a sharp pain, does it move around anywhere?"
4837,"No, the pain I feel it about in the same spot each time.","OK, and are you feeling the pain when you're coughing or is it when you're exerting yourself, like when do you feel the pain, and how long does it last?"
4838,"I, yeah, I will feel it when I cough. I also feel it uh, if I'm maybe moving around as well. Like changing positions or things like that. It hurts for a few minutes and then it it will kind of settle down. If if I'm, if I stay stationary and sort of lean forward a little bit it will it will start to feel better.","Sort of feels better? OK, and besides, besides like leaning forward, has anything helped reduce that pain at all?"
4839,"Yeah, well if I lie flat, uhm it, it's uh, or sorry. No actually, the pain gets worse if I I lie flat or if I'm if I'm taking a deep breath in. But really, the only thing that helps the pain is if I try to lean forward when I'm sitting down.","OK, I see, and do you have any pain when breathing in or out?"
4840,"I do, yeah it it gets worse if I if I'm taking a deep breath in, and even more so after I after I cough, if I'm trying to catch my breath, I'll feel it then too.","OK, and uhm, other than these symptoms, do you have any kind of shortness of breath? Do you have any dizziness or increased sweating, any of those symptoms?"
4841,"I have been sweating at night, but, uh, yeah that's it.",And how about any fevers or chills?
4842,"I I have felt a bit hot. That's more so yeah, maybe when I've been having night sweats, but I feel OK now.","OK, and when you say night sweats, are your sheets and blankets like soaked your pillows?"
4843,"Yeah, there there have been a few few nights for sure, but it doesn't happen every night. But over these last several months, it's been weird, I've woken up soaked.","OK, uh, do you have any other symptoms like a headache or nausea, vomiting?"
4844,No.,Have you measured a temperature at all?

4851,"No, I I uh, I guess I've been fatigued over the last couple of months, but I haven't had any flu like symptoms.","OK, and do you have any exposure to dust, fumes, animals anywhere in your surrounding?"
4852,"I do have uh, two cats at home, but I've had them for seven years now and I've been tested for allergies and and I'm clear there.",OK? Do you live with anyone right now?

4869,"Yeah, I I have actually. I'm I'm down 20 pounds. I thought that was great. I I was 200 pounds just two months ago.",And have you been trying to lose weight or that 20 pounds just went away spontaneously?
4870,"Uh, I mean I I guess I've tried to make changes to my diet here and there because of the diabetes, but I don't really think that it would be enough to lose 20 pounds.","OK, I see. Yeah so, do you have any questions? Those are all the questions I have. Do you have any questions or concerns?"
4871,"No, I was just, I guess just concerned about the the blood in the, in the cough.","Yeah, so definitely that's something concerning. We want to make sure there was no, so you work at a homeless shelter, where there may be a tuberculosis case, and your symptoms of coughing up blood as well as losing a significant weight recently, and some of the other symptoms that you described as well, point towards uh TB as one of the causes. No lung cancer history right, in your family?"
4872,No.,"OK, uhm so we definitely want to do testing for TB. Will do us a smear today of your sputum and we will, since you have been in contact with your family, we will have to contact a public health if the tests come back positive, and it seems that, we'll also do some other testing. Sometimes with tuberculosis you can get something called pericarditis, and some of the symptoms you are having may point to pericarditis as well, so we might have to do an EKG. We might have to further do an ultrasound, an x-ray, for example. So first we'll just get the TB test done and then if it comes back positive, you will need to isolate, be admitted to the hospital as well, and be on a course of antibiotics. So I know this is a lot to take in. Do you have any questions or concerns at all?"
4873,"Not right now. Guess will wait until some of the results come back and yeah, get started.","Yeah, so we'll just do the TB test first, alright?"
4874,"Alright, thank you.","Welcome, take care."
4875,"Yeah, I'm just bringing in my old daughter who's really been complaining about having a runny nose and has been sneezing a lot over this past over this past week. I think the symptoms maybe started three or four days ago.","OK, and what symptoms started first?"
4876,"I think the runny nose is what, what started first. And like kind of the nasal congestion. She was telling you that she felt that there was like pressure or congestion in her nose.","OK, and then this, when did this sneezing start?"
4877,Surely after that probably maybe the same day or or the next day.,"OK, does she have any coughing at all?"
4878,"Yeah, so she she did start to cough actually after that so that the cough has been there for the last, for the last maybe two to three days. It's a dry cough.","OK, for the last two to three days. OK, is she at all, coughing up any green or yellow material or any blood at all?"
4879,"No, nothing like that.","OK. So, and are her symptoms constant? Or do they come and go?"
4880,"They've been pretty constant, and they've gotten a little bit worse since they started. Three or four days ago, I I think now yeah, her symptoms are at her, at the worst right now. Just not feeling very well.","OK, and have you been in contact with anyone at home or at school? If she's going to school versus at home for the pandemic right now, but any ill contacts at all?"
4881,"Well, she has been going to school. There hasn't been any Covid cases where she goes and they've been cautious, but she is going to school right now.","OK. Any, anything that you've tried that has helped her like any over the counter cold medications?"
4882,"Uhm, uh, no.","OK. Any other symptoms like fevers, chills, shortness of breath, um, anything like that?"
4883,"Uh, she did feel a bit warm to touch and has looked a bit flushed in her face. Just doesn't look like herself.","Does she behave like herself Like is she more tired at all? More irritable, anything like that?"
4884,"Yeah, she's been a, maybe a bit more, maybe a bit more tired and and a bit more irritable, but not not too bad. She, she missed school today but went yesterday.",OK. Any recent travel at all?
4885,"No, we've been at home.","Any headaches, nausea or vomiting?"
4886,"Uhm, no.","OK, any chest pain that she's described?"

4891,"No, no no. She's been gaining weight well.","OK, any exposure to any allergens or like fumes, dust animals?"
4892,"No, I can't think of anything like that. We don't have any pets at Home and she's she's been hasn't been going anywhere else.","OK, has she been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?"

4898,"No, she hasn't said any anything like that, just the nasal congestion.",OK. Did you feel any pressure in around her face at all?
4899,"Uh, yeah, well yeah, I think so. She doesn't say, well, no pain but does feel like a bit of pressure with the congestion, I think.","OK, uhm any issues developmentally as she was growing up like to meet are all our milestones at an appropriate age?"
4900,"She did yeah, she has met she was walking at the appropriate times and able to talk and does work really well in school and is social with with her classmates and peers.","So no, no issues or no complaints at all?"
4901,"No, there hasn't been any concerns. I feel that she's been developing normally.",OK. In our immunizations up to date?
4902,"They are, yeah.",OK and were there any complications at all during your pregnancy with her or after the pregnancy?
4903,"No, it was a vaginal delivery at 38 weeks and she was a normal weight. We were able to go home right away with with no complications. So yeah, things were good.","OK, and currently who does she live with?"
4904,"So myself and my, and my husband.","OK, and does anyone smoke in the house?"
4905,"Uhm, my husband does smoke, but uh, I mean he smokes outside usually and and he smokes, I don't know, maybe a half a pack a day.",And I think that's all all the questions I have. Do you have any questions or concerns?
4906,Nothing else right now.,"OK. So yeah, based on her symptoms, she does seem to have some just a cold like symptoms, viral symptoms. And it's been, it's been you said three or four days in total, right?"
4907,Yeah yeah.,"Yeah, and so most likely it's just caused by a viral infection like common cold perhaps, it she doesn't have any worrying signs of any systemic things going on right now, so and no signs of like a bacterial infection that I would be concerned about that I would give antibiotics for right now. But definitely if her symptoms get worse at home and if she starts having any kind of shortness of breath, increased coughing with producing, more yellow or green material and if she gets more feverish, so will also do a physical exam and take her temperature today as well. But yeah, some of these things you just look out for, but yeah, so that that we'll do the physical examination and go from there."
4908,"Alright, thank you.","Hey, you're welcome. Take care."

4982,"Ah yeah, I I have a, I mean I have been feeling just tired this morning, but I think that's more to do with the fact that I just can't really do a whole lot of exertion because as soon as I move around I'm, I can't breathe.","I see.

5036,"No, I didn't go to see a doctor. I just kind of stay at home.",OK.
5037,I thought it was just like a mild infection or something.,Mhmm. Have you tried anything for the cough this time around?
5038,"I had some like lozenges and I haven't, and those have been helping me.",OK.
5039,"Uhm, I don't know. It's kind of like, like a normal cough, you know, like when you're clearing your throat or something, or when you're like when something gets stuck in your throat, just like like a normal cough. I don't think it's barky.","OK OK, are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any longstanding medical conditions?"
5040,"No, I don't. I don't.","No, OK. Have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?"
5041,I have my wisdom teeth removed.,"OK, when was that?"
5042,"About 8-9 years ago, when I was 17 years of 16 years old, ah, 17 years old.","OK, OK, and are you on any medications?"
5043,I'm just taking this birth control pill.,"OK, which one?"
5044,"Uhm, yeah, it's called, uhm, I forget the name.","Ah, no worries. And when did you start it?"
5045,I started three years ago.,"Three years ago, OK. And no side effects, no issues with it?"
5046,"No, no, it's all good.",And are you up to date with all your immunizations?
5047,"Uh, yeah, I think so.",OK. Did you get the flu shot this year?
5048,No I didn't.,"No. OK yeah, we recommend getting it out once a year. Just yeah, for your safety and for everyone else's and even if you get the flu, maybe your symptoms won't be as severe and then, do you have any allergies?"
5049,"Uh, I don't, no.","No, OK. Any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?"
5050,"Uhm, My mom has diabetes.",OK.
5051,And my dad has high blood pressure.,"OK. Uhm, and then any cancers in the family?"
5052,No.,"No, OK. And have you been in contact with any any sick people recently?"
5053,"No, I've just been staying at home.","OK. Uhm, any travel recently?"
5054,No.,"No, OK. How about umm smoking, do you smoke?"
5055,"Uhm, once in awhile.","OK, what's once in awhile?"
5056,"Maybe when I'm out with my friends I might sometimes, have a cigarette or two. I used to smoke a lot more, but I'm trying to cut it down.",OK. How long have you been smoking for?
5057,"I started smoking in high school, so when I was 18 years old.",Mhmm.
5058,"And at that time I would have about 6 cigarettes a day, but then I like I, I knew that smoking wasn't good for me, so I'm trying to cut it down, but my friends still smoke, so sometimes when I go out with them, I'll just have a cigarette or two, maybe like once a month, I would say.","Once a month, OK. OK. And then any other recreational drugs like marijuana or cocaine or anything like that?"
5059,"I tried a few in high school but not since then. I had, yeah, I had cocaine once.","OK, and do you drink alcohol?"
5060,Yeah I have a glass at night.,OK. Glass of wine or beer?
5061,Glass of wine.,"And, and where do you live right now?"
5062,"Uh, I live, I live in an apartment with my boyfriend, about 20 minutes from here.","OK. Any old carpets at home? Dust, mold, asbestos, anything that would be triggering your cough?"
5063,I don't know. I have not really had a problem but been here at this place for about a year and a half.,OK.
5064,It is an old building but it's been OK so far. No recent changes.,"OK, OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?"
5065,"No, I was just worried this cough isn't, isn't serious, right? You don't think I have Covid?","So because your symptoms do overlap with that of Covid, we're going to get a swab on you done and you should get those results in about 24 to 48 hours. And if it's positive, public health will be in touch umm, to do some contact tracing. In the meantime, because you have a cough, it is recommended that you isolate for 14 days. And if it's not Covid, but it's probably something like acute bronchitis or some other viral infection that's going around at this time of year, so for that we can, you can just treat it with like supportive treatments. You know, like staying hydrated, uhm, good nutrition, good sleep and just keep an eye on your symptoms. If they become worse or really severe like you're having neurological symptoms and just seek help from the ER."
5066,For sure. Thank you.,"Yeah, take care."
5067,Hi I'm here with my son and he's just been feeling awful. He just has this runny nose and he's been sneezing all the time and uh I don't know maybe he has allergies or something? I just came in 'cause I wanted to get him checked out and maybe get some medications. He's just feeling horrible.,"Yeah, for sure when did when did the sneezing and runny nose start?"
5068,"He he's had it for um, he's just always kind of, you know he's always having that runny nose. You know kids always do but it's just been pretty bad over the past um two weeks.","Past two weeks. OK. What started first, the sneezing or runny nose?"
5069,Uh the runny nose kind of just got worse a little bit over the past uh two weeks and then the sneezing kind of started at about the same time.,OK and and the runny nose is he having um like what colour is it?
5070,It's just clear like.,"Clear. OK. Does he ever feel like he's uh, do you ever feel like he's stuffy?"
5071,"Uh yeah, kind of. He's just been snorting and sniffing and um I don't think he knows how to blow his nose yet. But he's like clearing his throat, so I think he's he's a little bit stuffy.",Okay.
5072,"But he hasn't complained about difficulty with breathing or like, he's been, like he sleeps with his mouth closed. So I think he he should be able to breathe OK.","OK, good, so you said no shortness of breath or trouble breathing. Has he had any coughs?"
5073,"Kind of. In the morning, so I I see that whenever he wakes up in the morning, he just has to like clear his throat a lot and like cough and then um gets better.","OK, OK. Is he bringing up phlegm when he coughs?"
5074,"Um, a little bit.",What colour is it?
5075,It's the same stuff that comes out of his nose.,"OK yeah, so no blood or pus?"
5076,"No, no.","No? OK. Have you, do you think he's lost his like sense of smell or taste?"
5077,Uhh no.,No? OK. Any changes in his vision or hearing?
5078,Um I don't think so.,"No? Did like, um, have you noticed any discharge from his eyes?"
5079,"No, no. Sometimes he does have that, but no, not in the past two weeks.",OK so his like eyelids aren't swollen or his eyes aren't red?
5080,"No, no, no.","No? OK. And does he, have you noticed any swelling in his, either like face, neck, like belly area, or his limbs?"
5081,"No, no I haven't. It's just his nose is like a little bit red.",OK.
5082,"And uh yeah, he's just he's just itching all the time, just itching his nose, itching his um ears, yeah but no, no swelling.",No swelling. Have you noticed any rashes on him?
5083,"No, I checked yesterday night very carefully.","OK, good. Any weight loss?"
5084,"No, he's been gaining weight so um good that he's been eating well.","Yeah, that's good. Any fevers or chills?"
5085,No.,"No, does he look like he's like excessively tired?"
5086,"He's a little bit fatigued because of the sneezing and the, and the runny nose. You know, he's not going out to play as much.",Mhmm.
5087,"Um but it's not, you know he's still, he's still cheerful. He's not irritable or anything.","OK, OK. Um and then have you noticed that he's like, taking in like, rapid breaths?"

5093,No.,Headaches?
5094,No.,"No, OK. Um has he been like excessively itching anywhere?"
5095,"Um just his uh, just his nose and I think his like, I think his mouth is itchy too, 'cause he keeps doing this thing with his tongue just kind of, I don't know, just kind of like",OK.
5096,Um yeah just like his face is itchy.,"Hmm, OK. Um, has he come into any contact with sick people recently?"
5097,"Um, I don't, maybe. So, two weeks ago he was playing outside, um and I know that he, he does, his symptoms do get worse when he's outside, so I don't know, maybe.",OK.
5098,"He was playing with uh, with his brother but then this other kid from the neighbourhood also came around.","OK, OK. How about um travel to anywhere?"
5099,"No, we've just been staying at home.","OK, OK good. Um is he an otherwise healthy kid at the moment?"
5100,"Yeah, yeah, he's an, he's a healthy kid.","OK, um any complications when you were pregnant with him?"
5101,No.,No? Um how about at birth?
5102,"No, no complications.",OK. Did he need to be hospitalized after birth for any reason?
5103,No.,Any surgeries?
5104,No.,"Um, any allergies?"
5105,Um I don't think so. I know he's not.,No? He's never been diagnosed with like eczema or asthma?
5106,"Oh he's, he's had eczema. He had it.",OK.
5107,"Yeah, comes and goes.",His eczema comes and goes?
5108,Hmm.,"OK, um is he on any medications?"
5109,No.,No? Even for his eczema?
5110,It's pretty mild.,"OK. Um has, have you ever like given him um Reactine or like any of the, those anti allergy medications in the past?"
5111,"I've tried the, uh, yeah, the ones over the counter, um, they do help. Um, I tried it this time, but uh it didn't do much.","OK. OK. And, I was gonna ask you something else. Um, his symptoms, like the sneezing and the, and the runny nose, like has he experienced this before?"
5112,Oh yeah.,OK.
5113,"It usually gets worse um uh I guess like around this time, uh I can tell when spring is coming up. Um, it gets pretty bad, but he always has a runny nose um and he sneezes sometimes here and there.","OK, and you mentioned this has been going on for more than four days this time around?"
5114,"It's been, it's been going on for the past uh two weeks.","OK. OK, and is it like um impairing his like daily activities or like his ability to um like, sleep?"
5115,"Uh it does affect his sleep sometimes he doesn't like um, just the itching really bothers him.",Mhmm.
5116,"So he can't uh, he finds it hard to fall asleep. That's like, I usually, that's when I give him the the medications. To help him fall asleep.",OK. OK. And uh is he up to date with all his immunizations?
5117,Yeah.,"OK. Any family history of asthma, eczema, or something called allergic rhinitis?"
5118,Uh I have asthma.,OK. And is your asthma severe?
5119,"Uh no, it's it's pretty well controlled. I used to, actually, I used to have asthma as a child.","OK, I see."
5120,It's pretty well controlled right now. I don't even need medications.,"OK, OK."
5121,"I remember I used to, I used to get allergies as well as a child.",Oh I see.
5122,"But very similar, lots of sneezing and yeah.","Mhmm, alright. Were you ever, did you ever take like an allergy test?"
5123,"No. I didn't think about it, I just never, like my my my parents didn't take me to get that testing done.","OK, how about your son? Has he been allergy tested?"
5124,"No, but I feel like he probably should.","Yeah, OK. And then, does anyone at home smoke?"
5125,No.,"No, OK. Um do you have any, like old carpets, dust, mold, or asbestos at your place?"
5126,"Uh we've got all of, we got our carpets uh removed uh two years ago. That's actually helped uh with his symptoms. Uh and I know, we tried it, we removed the curtains as well and we've used blinds. So yeah.",OK.
5127,"And I don't think so, I don't think there's any spores or things like that.","OK, good. Um, is he an otherwise healthy child like developmental wise, like he's growing, gaining weight OK, like he's, his motor skills and like social behaviours are all up to par with his peers?"
5128,Oh yeah he's doing great.,OK OK good um those are all the questions I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?
5129,No.,"No, OK. So for him um it sounds more in keeping with something called allergic rhinitis than an infection, but because his symptoms do overlap with that of Covid,  we'll probably get him a swab anyways, and those results should come back in 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, rhinitis is, allergic rhinitis is caused by allergies to certain things, so we can get him allergy tested um and that will give us a better understanding of like what his triggers are and the way to treat that is to avoid those triggers, those allergens. And if his symptoms are persistent, um we will prescribe him also like an intranasal corticosteroid. Um and there are like, there are like second line treatments as well, like antihistamines and leukotriene, like leukotriene receptor antagonists, but those are like second line. We'll we'll see how he does with the inhaled corticosteroids at first. How does that sound?"
5130,Sounds great.,"OK, great."
5131,Thank you.,No problem.
5132,"Hi. Uh, I've just had this cough for the past week and I was worried I might have Covid so I just wanted to um I just wanted to be checked.","Sure, so you mentioned you, it started a week ago."
5133,Yeah.,Has it been persistent or does it come and go?
5134,Um it's just been there.,Been there. OK.
5135,"Yeah, I just get this itchy sort of uh like scratchy sensation in my throat. And then I just cough and um that makes it better.","OK. OK, uhm what, how would you describe your cough like is it barky? Is it harsh? Is it muffled?"
5136,"Uhm no, I don't I don't think it's barky or harsh.","OK, and does anything make it better or worse like you know, like the cold air, laying down, at particular time of day?"
5137,"Not really, I haven't uh, nothing's really helped. Um I also tried a cough syrup, um it didn't, it helped for a couple hours, but then it was back again. The cough was back again.","OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?"
5138,"Uh well, I I said yeah when I get a cold.","Mhmm, OK."
5139,Once a year maybe.,Once a year? OK. Um do you experience any shortness of breath with this cough?
5140,No.,"No, OK. Is it a dry cough or do you bring up any phlegm?"
5141,"No, it's a dry cough.","OK, uh any blood that you've seen?"
5142,"No, no.","No, OK. And do you feel wheezy?"
5143,No.,"No, chest pain?"

5148,No.,"No, any changes in your vision or hearing?"
5149,Uh no.,A sore throat?
5150,No.,Um loss of smell or taste?
5151,No.,Any weight loss?
5152,Uh no.,Fevers?
5153,"I checked no, no, I don't have a fever.","No, any rashes?"
5154,No.,"Issues uh, any changes in your bowel movements?"
5155,"Um uh no, I've just been constipated from time to time, but that's nothing, that's not new.","OK, constipation. And I'm sorry when did your constipation start?"
5156,Oh it's a problem for years. I don't eat enough fibre.,"Oh, OK. Any changes in your urine?"
5157,No.,"OK, any nausea or vomiting?"
5158,"Uh, no.","No, OK. Any joint pain?"
5159,No.,"No, numbness or tingling?"
5160,No.,Headaches?
5161,No.,"No, OK. Are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any longstanding medical conditions?"
5162,I have diabetes.,"OK, how long have you had diabetes?"
5163,"It's about, it's been uh seven years now.","OK, any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?"
5164,No.,OK and um how about medications? Are you on any?
5165,"Uh yeah, I've been taking uh metformin for the past uh, for the past five years, when, five or six years.",OK.
5166,"Um and uh my family Doc started me on uh ramipril about two weeks ago, he told me that uh now that I'm 50, I need to I need to be on this pill as well, so now I have to take 2 pills instead of one.",OK.
5167,Yeah because I think it's it's good for my heart or something.,"Yeah, for sure. So you started that two weeks ago, OK. Are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
5168,"Uh yeah, I think so.","OK, any allergies?"
5169,"Uhm penicillin, I just get uh I get a rash. I got a rash when I was a child, I haven't had it since then.","OK, OK. Any family history of lung or heart conditions?"
5170,"Uh no, nothing like that.","No, OK. Do you smoke?"
5171,"Uh, no.","No, how about, uh, marijuana or other recreational drugs?"
5172,No.,"No, OK, um alcohol?"
5173,"Uh yeah, I drink on the weekends.","OK, what do you drink and how much do you drink?"
5174,I'll have maybe two or three uh bottles of beer.,"OK sure, and um have you been in contact with any sick people recently?"
5175,"No, no, I've just been staying at home.I'm just scared of covid, but I'm I'm still worried I might have somehow gotten it.","Yeah, for sure. Uhm, any travel recently?"
5176,No.,"No, OK. And where do you live right now?"
5177,I live in a house with my wife and my two kids.,"OK, uh are they healthy?"
5178,"Yeah, they're all healthy.","OK. Any old carpet, dust, mold, or asbestos in your home?"
5179,Um not that I'm aware of.,"No, OK. OK, well it seems like um those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?"
5180,"Uh no, I just want to get tested for Covid.","Yeah, so we will definitely do a Covid swab on you because you have a cough, um and those results should come back to you in about 24 to 48 hours, and so you'll know more then. But because your symptoms do overlap with that of Covid, we still recommend isolating for 14 days. But the other thing I want to mention is that you don't have any other symptoms of infection besides your cough, and it seems like the cough started a week ago and you started this new medication ramipril two weeks ago, and so ramipril is a type of ACE inhibitor and one of its side effects is that in some people it can cause coughing. So, I am going to review your medications and if your family Doc also agrees, we may try uh another um blood pressure medication for you instead of ramipril."
5181,Sure.,Um so we'll try and change that medication and see if your coughing stops. How does that sound?
5182,Sounds great.,"OK, great, thank you."
5183,"Hi, I've just had a runny nose and a cough for the past uh week.","OK, um so for the past week you said, did the cough start first, or the runny nose?"
5184,"Uh it started with the cough. I usually don't come in when I have symptoms like this uh, but I've just been, uhm, I just heard of someone who passed away due to Covid and I'm just like very scared and I just decided to come in.","Yeah, for sure that's understandable. Um With the cough, is it a dry cough or are you bringing up some phlegm?"
5185,Um it's mostly a dry cough,"Dry cough. OK, um and is it persistent or does it come and go?"
5186,It comes and goes. It does get better when I um take um like over the counter medications for for um like the antitussive pills.,OK yeah yeah. Um and does anything make it worse like the cold air or certain times of the day or like when you're laying down?
5187,Um the cold air does make it a little bit uh worse.,OK. And have you experienced something like this in the past?
5188,"Uh yeah, I usually I do get a cold um couple times a year.","OK yeah, that makes sense. Um and any shortness of breath?"
5189,"Um no, no I don't think so.","No, any wheeziness?"
5190,Um no.,Chest pain?
5191,No.,"Um, how about a stuffy nose?"
5192,"Yeah, I do have a stuffy nose.","OK, when your nose does run, do you notice that it's like uh yellow in colour or red?"
5193,"No, no.","No, OK, so it's clear?"
5194,"It's clear, yeah.","OK, any changes in your vision or hearing?"
5195,No.,Smell or taste?
5196,"Um I I can't smell as as much, but I think maybe it's just because my nose is so stuffy, but also that made me a little bit concerned about Covid, but no problems with taste.","OK, good any weight loss recently?"
5197,"Um I've been trying to lose weight, but nothing unintentional I guess.","OK yeah, and then any fevers?"
5198,Uh no.,"No fevers huh, OK. Any like excessive fatigue?"
5199,"I am tired but not, I guess it's not too bad.","Yeah OK, and how about like rashes?"
5200,"No, I haven't noticed any.","No rashes, OK. Um any uh, sorry, I asked you if you had chest pain, uh do you ever feel like your heart's racing?"
5201,No.,"No, OK. Any changes to your bowel movements?"
5202,No.,"No, um nausea or vomiting?"
5203,"Uhm, no.","No, OK. Uhm how about headaches?"
5204,"Uhm, no.",Fainting spells or dizziness?
5205,No.,Joint pain?
5206,Um no.,"No, OK."
5207,"Just my body feels a little achy, but.",Yeah.
5208,No like specific joint pains.,"OK, and then any uh major illnesses that are longstanding?"
5209,Um I don't know does depression count? I do have depression.,"OK, yeah, for sure. How, when were you diagnosed with depression?"
5210,Uh when I was 15 years old.,"15, OK. Um are you on any medications?"
5211,I'm I'm on Prozac.,"Prozac, OK. And when were you diagnosed uh, prescribed that?"
5212,Um I've just been on different medications uh over the past few years. Um this one seems to be working well. I started this about a year ago.,"OK good good, any allergies?"
5213,"Uhm, no.",Are you up to date with all your immunizations?
5214,Mhmm.,Um any family history of lung or heart disease?
5215,"Uh, just um high cholesterol.","OK. Um how about smoking, do you smoke?"
5216,No.,Um any other recreational drugs like marijuana?
5217,"Um yeah, sometimes. I'll just have a joint um maybe um two or three times a week.","OK, OK. And is that for like medical purposes or just like recreationally?"
5218,Uh just you know just to relax.,"OK, sure. Um alcohol?"
5219,Uh no.,"No, OK. And have you been around any sick people recently?"
5220,"Um I went to I went grocery shopping and and someone near me was coughing. I was still like six, you know, I was away from them but, I don't like, yeah, I don't know.","Yeah, for sure. I think that you're, it's fair that you're concerned about that. And how about travel to anywhere?"
5221,"No, I haven't traveled anywhere.","No, OK. OK, well those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?"
5222,No.,"No, OK. So we'll do a covid swab anyways today because your, some of your symptoms do overlap with that of Covid and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. But in the meantime you should self isolate for 14 days."
5223,Sure.,"Um but it I think it does really sound like you have a common cold um so just like another viral illness, um so just treat it supportively you know um keep yourself hydrated, if you feel like you're getting a fever, take like Tylenol. Um if you have like pain like a headache or like sinus pressure or something you can take again an Advil or Tylenol. Um And if your symptoms worsen, or if you have any neurological symptoms, then you should see the ER um right away."
5224,Sure.,"Yeah, OK sounds good."
5225,"Hi, um so for the past week or so I've um I've had this cough um and some shortness of breath. I feel hot and I just feel kind of uh fuzzy like I just I can't concentrate on things very well. I get confused sometimes so I thought I'll come to you to get it checked out.","Yeah, yeah it's it's that was a really good idea to come in to get checked out. Um so can you uh, I'll talk I'll ask about each symptom a little bit. So starting with the shortness of breath can you um tell me how uh bad the shortness of breath has been?"
5226,"Uh it's been sometimes it's not so bad, some other times it's really bad. Um at first it wasn't that bad, but now like I'm having a hard time taking a deep breath in. Um it hurts and I just feel like I can't walk like 2 blocks even before getting short of breath.","And uh before this week how much did, did you ever feel short of breath before this?"
5227,"No, nothing like this before.","No, OK. Um do you feel that the shortness of breath has gotten kind of worse over time?"
5228,"Yeah, I think so.",And what about the cough? Did that start at the same time as the as the difficulty with breathing?
5229,Um it started before the difficulty with breathing.,"Can you, uh is it a dry cough or a wet cough?"
5230,"Um it was it was a dry cough at first, but now I'm seeing some phlegm um and it looks kind of yellow.",Have you seen any blood in the phlegm?
5231,No.,"Uhm and, uh, are you hearing any wheezing sounds?"
5232,"Yeah, a little bit.","OK. Um how uh, has the cough sort of improved or gotten worse over time?"
5233,Um it's it's gotten worse.,OK. And you mentioned you also you also have a fever. Did you check your temperature?
5234,Um I did I it was like 38.5 this morning.,"And have you been checking your fever this past week, or was that the first time you, um, checked it?"
5235,It's the first time I checked it. I I've felt hot though in the past and I've felt like I had chills.,"Yeah. You're also feeling a little bit fuzzy. When did that start, and can you explain that a little bit?"
5236,"That started about um, I think like yesterday morning. Um I just feel fuzzy like I can't concentrate on things as much as I used to be able to. And the other day I uh was cooking something and then I forgot I was cooking it. Um yeah, just a little bit confused.",Did you leave the stove on?
5237,"No, no, I had turned it off. I just forgot I left like the pot on the stove and made dinner.","OK, OK and you feel like this is very new, that this has not been going on for weeks or months where you forget things or having difficulties with concentration?"

5305,"Oh, I didn't get that this year.","OK, well we recommend that you you get your vaccines and um also the uh HPV vaccine. Um it's it's best to get the HPV vaccine earlier on. It's a little bit less effective as you um go past a certain age, you are still obviously nowhere close to that, but it's,  I I don't believe it's covered after the age of 26 either, so it's best if you get it done earlier. And let's go back to your symptoms, then. Have you had any surgeries?"
5306,"Uhm, I got my appendix removed when I was 13.",Anything else?

5322,"Yeah we do, except sometimes I guess like I don't know if you have to drink water or something, we take it off.","Yeah, sure, OK. Um and uhm, I suppose just um OK. What was I gonna ask? Um do you uh, so no travels, OK. Do you feel like you've been in contact with someone who might be sick or might have Covid?"
5323,Uh I don't think so.,"No, OK alright. And have you looked at your throat? Does it look swollen or red?"
5324,"Yeah, it looks pretty swollen and red.","Well, that's all the questions, oh one more question actually. Do you have um any medical conditions that run in the family?"
5325,"Um no, I don't think so. Maybe like high blood pressure.","Uh all right, well um that's all the questions I had. We'll do a physical exam, have a look inside your throat. Um given uh the symptoms that you have, it sounds like you have um an an inflammation or swelling of your throat which could be caused by bacteria or viruses. It could be something like um mono, or it could be um strep throat. Um it could be other things as well. Um seeing that your symptoms are somewhat overlapping with the symptoms for covid, we would also like to do a Covid test. Um we'll do a rapid strep test here as well um just to rule it out and then uh we'll uh ask you to quarantine for the next 14 days um until or at least until your covid swabs are back or your symptoms improve um and we'll let you know about um the management based on the strep test result. Do you have any questions?"
5326,"Um no, that sounds great, thank you.",OK sounds good.
5327,"Yeah, I brought my son here. I'm a little bit worried about him because like yesterday he had he had this temperature of like 38.5 um so he's been feeling a little bit hot and he's not swallowing his food, like we've been feeding him some mashed up food but he's not swallowing it. He's just kind of throwing throwing it back out there. Um he's drooling now uh and he sounds kind of muffled um and he's been very short of breath.","That doesn't sound good. Um uh yeah, I'm I'm currently looking at him and he doesn't uh look great. While the uh while the doctor's um taking his vitals and examining the baby, I'll just ask you a couple of questions."
5328,Sure,So you said that all of this started about a day ago. How was he doing before that?
5329,"He was fine before that, he had like a an infection, like some sort of viral infection recently, like about a week back, he had like a runny nose and a cough, but that went away.","Um OK, so he had these symptoms about a week ago. Did he see any, did you take him to the hospital or to a clinic?"
5330,"I took him to our family doctor um and they just suggested some supportive treatments um which we've been doing at home like we try to keep him well hydrated, and we've been keeping an eye on his like um diapers and things like that.","OK, has he been um has he been, how many diapers is he um, are you changing a day?"
5331,"Usually like about 5, 6, but yesterday it was like 2.",OK. Um and uh has he been uh irritable or agitated?
5332,Uh he has been very irritable and fussy.,Has he been sleeping OK?
5333,I um no you know what last night he didn't sleep well at all. He was crying the whole night.,"Um and uh in terms of uh, so how much has he has he had to eat or drink in the past uh day or two?"
5334,"Uh he's had about like maybe a bottle of his milk, like of that.",OK.
5335,Yeah.,That's it?
5336,"Yeah, he's not taking. He's not he's not taking anything else like he's been so fussy and so like he's unwilling to try anything.","OK, um and, OK. Do you feel like he's been drowsy uh and um lethargic?"
5337,"Um yeah, I feel like he's been a little bit lethargic. Like today, he's more lethargic. All of yesterday, he was very fussy and irritable, but today seems like, he's very slow.","OK, and just a couple of questions about um his past medical history. Does he have any uh medical conditions uh that he was diagnosed with?"
5338,"Uh no, he's been healthy otherwise.",How was your pregnancy with him?
5339,"Normal, yeah no complications there.",Did did you have GBS or gestational diabetes?

5343,No.,Was he um kept in the hospital for a couple days in the NICU after he was born?
5344,No.,Did he develop jaundice?
5345,No.,"OK, and and he's been OK for the past two years? Any concerns about his growth, his height and weight, and his head circumference? Has your family doctor uh said anything about that?"
5346,"No, he's been pretty good. Um he's been growing and gaining weight OK.",Any um developmental issues?
5347,No.,"OK, alright, and any medical conditions that run in the family?"

5350,No surgeries.,Uh has he been on any medications? Any antibiotics recently?
5351,No.,"OK. Has um has he been vaccinated? Uh has his vaccinations, immunizations up to date?"
5352,"Yeah, they're all up to date so far.","OK, alright, that's that's good. Um OK, and does he have any allergies that you're aware of?"
5353,Pardon me?,Any allergies?
5354,"Oh, uh no allergies.","OK alright um well it looks like um I, it's great that you brought him into the emergency room. Um if he hasn't been eating, drinking well, hasn't slept well, has been fussy, and and has been lethargic and tired, uh and is having difficulty swallowing food, um that's definitely very um serious. Uh we'll have a look inside his mouth and see what's going on. It could be that he has an infection or an inflammation of some sort. Um given his fever, he probably has an infection, um and uh we'll likely start him on antibiotics and put in an IV drip just to get in get some fluids inside him, just to get him hydrated, uh and monitor him very closely. We'll also check his vitals and um we'll do uh, yeah, we'll go from there. Do you have any questions?"
5355,"Uh no, thank you.",OK.
5356,"Um yeah, so I'm here because I've had this fever, this cough, and now my head hurts. That's been going on for about the past four days and I just want to make sure um it's nothing too serious.","Yeah, yeah, that's great. So can you tell me, have you, did you measure your temperature?"

5363,Yeah.,And uh where exactly is it?
5364,So it's like just on the front part of my head.,"And does it feel like uh, what does it feel like? Is it like a throbbing sensation? A band like sensation? Um is it sharp, is it dull?"
5365,Uh it feels pretty throbbing right now.,Is it both sides or on the uh left or right?
5366,Uh it's it seems like it's both sides.,"If you had to give it a number from 1 to 10 with 10 being the most severe pain ever, what number would you give it?"

5371,"No, nothing like that.",Have you had a similar headache in the past?

Um and uh it could be that you have uh some sort of an infection, uh including um, with Covid being one of the possibilities, and so um continue to take Tylenol and and um monitor your uh fever. If it continues to get worse, or you um notice that your symptoms are just not getting better, um you should come back, you should uh, we'll also do a Covid, we'll also send in a request for a Covid swab. Um and uh we'll ask you to quarantine for the for the next 14 days and try to stay away from your husband and daughter as well, if you can at home.

Um and like last week I I've just been constantly coughing. So yeah, I was just a bit concerned.","Yeah, OK, so you said the past couple of years you've been coughing. So how many years exactly would that be? Two, three, four?"
5407,"Probably five I would say, and I was diagnosed with uh COPD around that time.","OK, OK, um the cough that you currently have, um is it a dry cough or are you bringing up any phlegm?"

5409,"It's pretty much there all the time, but uh it's definitely getting worse. Um it is, I think, the worst in the morning um when I wake up and I just feel like there's just a bunch of gunk stuck in the back of my throat.","OK. Um and if you were to describe the quality of this cough, would you say it's harsh, barky, muffled?"
5410,I would say it's harsh.,"Harsh, OK. And has the quality of your cough changed at all in the past few years? Like does it sound different than it used to?"
5411,"Um I don't know if it sounds different, but uh especially for the last month I would say I'm bringing up more of the material, and it's usually white over the five years, but um I noticed uh in the last week-ish, it's had a yellowish tinge to it as well.","OK, OK, so it's changed a little bit. Um and are you experiencing any shortness of breath with this?"
5412,"No I I don't think so, like I sometimes when I'm walking around uh doing more stuff, uh working in the garden like I feel like I might have to breathe a little bit harder, but uh not regularly.","OK, OK, that's good. Um and any wheezing?"
5413,"Uh, yeah. It's like usually I start coughing a lot more when I'm starting to do any kind of activities and sometimes when I start coughing more, I also start wheezing.

5438,"Yes I'm on, no worries, I'm on um uh two puffers right now. One of them is like just one that I use when I really need it. And then um there's another one, so I think that's like the Ventolin puffer.",Yeah.
5439,"And then the other one is called, I think it's called Spiriva.","OK, OK perfect. And are your puff puffers giving you any relief at all from the coughing fits?"
5440,"Yeah, I've been using the Ventolin uh more and it it does seem to help.","OK, OK. Uh do you find they're not working as much as they used to though?"
5441,"Yeah, I feel like uh before, I didn't really like, it, just last year I didn't really have to take it too much. Um like even when I use the puffer, I start getting coughing like maybe half an hour later and so it's not, I don't think it's as effective.","OK, yeah. Um OK. And have you had any recent blood work done?"
5442,"Uh, no, I haven't been to the doctor for a while.",OK. And do you have any allergies?
5443,"Um I think I have allergies to uh like um amoxicillin, I got like a rash once.","OK. Have you had any, uh, amoxicillin, or like penicillin type antibiotics recently?"
5444,No.,"No, OK. Um are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
5445,Yep.,"OK. Um, you're not quite at this age range yet, but uh we do recommend the pneumococcal vaccine when you turn 65. And um did you get the flu vaccine this year?"
5446,"Uh yeah I did, with the pandemic going on, I usually don't get it, but I got it this year.","OK, good good. Um any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?"
5447,"Uhm, lung conditions I don't think so. Heart conditions, uh my father did have a heart attack in his 60s, but he's fine. He's he's living right now.","OK OK, any cancers?"
5448,"Cancers, I think my uncle from my father's side um had uh bladder cancer.","OK, OK. Um do you smoke?"
5449,I used to smoke. Um I just quit a few years ago.,"OK, congrats. Um how much did you used to smoke?"
5450,"Uhm, I don't know, probably I went through a like a whole pack every day, I would say for at least 30 years of my life.","OK, OK um so it's good that you stopped. Um do you take any other recreational drugs?"
5451,"Uh no, nothing like that.","No, OK. How about alcohol? Do you drink?"
5452,"Uh I drink every like, maybe a beer a day.",OK. Um are you um living with anyone right now?
5453,"Yeah, it's just uh me and my wife.","OK, where do you guys live?"
5454,Uh we just live uh outside of the city in in a condominium.,"OK, any uh old carpets? Mold, dust, asbestos, anything like that in the condo?"
5455,"No, it's pretty well maintained.","OK, good. And have you been in contact with any anyone sick recently?"
5456,"No, I've mainly just been trying to stay inside. I work from home too, so haven't really been seeing anyone.","OK, that's good. And um travel to anywhere recently? Outside the province?"
5457,"Uhm, outside of the province, no, not not for like the last year at least.","OK, OK. Um so those were kind of all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for me?"
5458,"Um yeah, I was just wondering like what you think it might be.","Yeah, so it definitely sounds like a COPD exacerbation, but because your symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will take a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and you can you can self isolate for 14 days um and if it's positive, public health will be in touch with you to um do some contact tracing, but in the meantime we'll also do a work up for the COPD exacerbation. Um it seems like you have taken the correct steps so far in like stopping like stopping your smoking and um taking your puffers as needed. Um so right now we will continue using the puffers that you have, and if you don't already have a long acting beta agonist, we'll give you that as well as, if it's like if it gets really severe, we'll also give you some inhaled corticosteroids um and we'll also check your oxygen saturation to make sure it's over uh 88% um and we'll give you oxygen if you need it. Um as well, some antibiotics to consider, you mentioned that you were allergic to amoxicillin, so we might give you like a macrolide like azithromycin for now. Um and hopefully your symptoms subside and we can get you home. How does that sound?"
5459,"OK, that sounds good. Thank you so much.","Yeah, no problem. And I forgot, sorry we'll also probably do like a chest X Ray and a pulmonary function test."
5460,"OK, sounds good.","Yeah, no problem."
5461,"Yeah, so uh I'm just bringing my son uh here to the clinic. He's been having um just I think he's been complaining of uh ear ache in his uh I think it's mainly in his left ear for the last, I'd say at least a week. Um he's been kind of just having discomfort um and over the last few days uh he also started crying because of how much pain he is having, and then um we also noticed that he had like was just feeling warm, so we took his temperature and he actually had a fever just yesterday of like 39 degrees Celsius.","OK, uhm, alright. So let's back up just a little bit. The ear pain, when did that start? You said a couple of days ago, so was that two, three, four days?"
5462,"Uh I think the discomfort like uh, we saw him scratching his ear for the whole last week, but uh the crying actually started just I would say four days ago, um.",OK.
5463,So I think the last few days have been really tough for him.,"Yeah, so three, four days. OK, have you taken a look into his ear? Like does does it seem red? Is there discharge?"
5464,"Uh I think we did see some uh, just like it wasn't red or anything, but I think we did uh see some um just kind of clear to almost uh clear to yellowish fluid from his affected ear.","OK, clear to, you said white-ish?"
5465,Uh like it was a bit of a yellow tinge to to it as well.,"Yellow, OK, OK. And which ear was it, sorry, the right or left?"
5466,Left ear.,"Left ear, OK. And the right ear looks normal?"
5467,"Yeah, right ear, he hasn't been complaining uh at all. I haven't even looked at the right ear yet.","OK, is he itching his ears at all?"
5468,"Uh he was he was itching like pretty much this whole week, but I think right now he's hesitant to even touch his ears.","OK, and does it look like it's angry on the outside or on the inside of his ears?"
5469,I can't really see anything on the outside.,"OK, OK, and have you noticed that his hearing has changed at all?"
5470,"Um he still like answers to us and like I don't think his ear, hearing is affected.","OK. Has he had any past issues with his ears, like ear infections or like hearing issues in the past?"
5471,"Uh no hearing issues, but he did have uh like he used to, probably when he was uh like 2 years old, he did have a couple ear infections.","OK, OK. Were they were they treated with antibiotics?"
5472,"Uh I think one time they were, but I I'm pretty sure that was on, in his right ear.","OK, OK. He's never had to get like tubes inserted or anything like that?"
5473,"No, no, nothing like that.","No, OK. Um, alright. Um has he had a stuffy nose or runny nose?"
5474,"Uh not this week, but he he was a bit like stuffy like last week I would say.","OK, he was a bit stuffy, you said?"
5475,"Yeah, maybe even, maybe two weeks ago.",OK. And that stopped. Did he have anything else along with his stuffy nose at that point?
5476,"No, nothing else.","Um right now, have you noticed any changes in his vision, in his smell or taste?"
5477,"Uh mo, not that I know of.","OK, how about weight loss?"
5478,"No, he's been um growing pretty well.","OK, and you said um you had taken his temperature. When did you take his temperature?"
5479,I just took it yesterday but uh he was feeling a bit warm yesterday so we just took it and it was like um 39 degrees Celsius.,"OK, OK sweet. Um so 39 degrees, so he does have a fever uh for sure. We'll take his temperature again today just to make sure. Have you been giving him anything for his high temperature, like Tylenol?"
5480,"No, we haven't given him anything.",OK. Have you noticed any rashes on him?
5481,No.,"No, um how about coughing?"
5482,"Uh no, he hasn't been really coughing.","No coughing, how about wheezing or shortness of breath?"
5483,No.,Like anything that would indicate he has chest pain or palpitations of his heart?
5484,"No, I don't think so.","No, OK. Any dizziness or fainting spells?"
5485,No.,Confusion?
5486,"No, I don't think so.",Headaches?
5487,Uh not that I know of.,"OK, and how how have his bowel movements been?"
5488,"His bowel movements have been pretty much the same, um he's uh, yeah, there's been no real changes.","No, OK. Um alright, and how about uh nausea or vomiting?"
5489,"Uh no, no, no nausea or vomiting.",Any appetite change?
5490,"Uh no, uh, maybe a little bit more fussy just, but I don't know if that's probably due to the pain.",OK. Um and how about his urine?
5491,"Uh his urine has been the same, like no changes.","No changes, OK good. Is he an otherwise healthy kid or does he have any longstanding conditions?"
5492,"Yeah, he's pretty healthy. There have been no concerns at all that we've had for the doctor. Uh he's been growing well, um meeting all of his milestones. Um yeah, no, nothing that's concerning.","OK, um do you know if his mother's pregnancy with him was normal? Did she have any complications?"
5493,"Um she didn't have any like complications during the pregnancy. Uh they did have to, um I forgot what it's called, but uh he was like a difficult baby coming out. Um and he was at term though, he wasn't premature, but they had to use just um some tools to get him out.","OK, OK. Um so it was a vaginal delivery, but they used some tools like forceps maybe or vacuum?"
5494,"Yeah, yeah it was forceps, yeah.","OK, OK. Um and he's, you mentioned he was full term?"
5495,"Yeah, he was born at uh 40 weeks.","OK, perfect. Did he need to be hospitalized for any reason after that?"
5496,"No, he wasn't hospitalized. Uh we stayed there maybe one day extra just because um there was some just kind of misshaping of his head.",OK.
5497,That kind of went away.,"OK, OK, good. And is he on any medications?"
5498,"Uh no, no medications.","No medications, up to date with his immunizations?"
5499,"Yeah, he's all up to date.","OK, any allergies?"
5500,Um not that we know of.,"OK, how about family history of lung conditions, heart conditions?"
5501,"Um no, we've been pretty healthy as parents. Um and I think my my father has like high blood pressure, diabetes, and all those types of things.","OK, OK, any um ear issues like congenital ear, sorry um, genetic hearing issues or ear issues?"
5502,"No, nothing like that.","OK, um does anyone at home smoke?"
5503,"No, no one smokes.",OK. Um and who does he live with?
5504,"So he lives with um me, his father, and his mother as well.","OK. Uhm, any siblings?"
5505,"No siblings, he's an only child.","OK, and how are things at home, um is like, are things financially stable? Any relationship issues?"
5506,"No, we've been pretty uh fortunate like it it's, no financial issues uh and we have a lot of support from our parents as well. Uh the relationship is great, so no, no issues.","OK, good good. Um has he had any sick contacts recently?"
5507,"Um I don't think so. He's, we've been at home so I don't know. We we did have like, with our with my brother's uh kids like uh they came to see us once um but that was like, that was, I think at like three weeks ago.","OK, OK, three weeks ago. Alright, um travel to anywhere recently?"
5508,No.,"No, OK. Alright, those were all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions that you wanted to ask me today before we end the interview?"
5509,"Uh no, not really. Just wanted to know if, like I remember he did need antibiotics before so I was just wondering if he needs them now.","Yeah, um so, well first, because some of his symptoms overlap with Covid, like the fever especially, we'll do a swab on him anyways um and you should hear those results in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and then it, this picture sounds like acute otitis media, so like an ear infection. And um it's especially likely because he's had them in the past, so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before like um coming up with a management plan. But I'll kind of walk you through what we look at. So if I take a look and I see like a perforated tympanic membrane with like pus, we'd prescribe like 10 days of um antibiotics. If he has some like middle ear effusion, so like some fluids with like a bulging tympanic membrane and he appears to be really ill, uh which from the sounds of it, he sounds ill, he's had this fever for more than two days, we'll also prescribe antibiotics for 10 days. And then, if it's just some middle ear effusion, so just that clear fluid um or just the bulging tympanic membrane, we can just um reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see how he's doing. And if he's worse, again, we'll prescribing prescribe him some antibiotics. Um the antibiotics that we usually prescribe are amoxicillin, and because he doesn't have a penicillin allergy, that should work."
5510,OK.,"Yeah, how does that sound?"
5511,That sounds good. Thank you so much.,"OK, great, thank you."
5512,"Yeah, so I just came in today uh a bit concerned. Uh I've been just having this nasty cough for like the last week and then today morning uh, like I thought the cough would just go away, but today morning I also noticed I'm coughing up some blood.","Oh, OK."
5513,Yeah.,So when did you first start coughing?
5514,"Um, so let me think uh I just returned from a mission trip uh to the Philippines 2 weeks ago. This cough started uh just last week, so I would say around six to seven days.","OK. And that and the blood in your cough, um that was about yesterday, you said? Or?"
5515,"Yeah today, uh.","Today, OK. OK. Um are you bringing up any phlegm at all, besides the blood?"
5516,"Uh no it's just uh like I saw it on my hand, like there wasn't anything, like my cough is like pretty dry.","OK, are you short of breath at all?"
5517,"No, I'm not short of breath. Um just, it's just the cough.","OK, and are you having any wheeziness?"
5518,Uh no wheeziness.,OK. Um any runny nose or stuffy nose?
5519,"No, no uh runny or stuffy nose.","Changes in vision, hearing, smell, or taste?"
5520,Nope.,Uh weight loss?
5521,"Um I have noticed uh weight loss over the last uh, I would say few months. So I've been I've been doing like like I I came back from Philippines last week, but um, I had gone earlier, like during this year or two and I've kind of noticed this weight change, probably lost around 15 pounds within the last few months.","15 pounds OK. Wow, that's a lot, yeah. Um any night sweats?"
5522,"Um no, I don't think so, no.",Any fevers or chills?
5523,"I did have a, I did have some chills over the last week, um but I didn't really think too much of it.","OK, we'll take your temperature today just to make sure. Um any rashes?"
5524,No.,Any chest pain?
5525,No chest pain.,Uh swelling in your limbs?
5526,No.,Fainting spells or dizziness?
5527,"No, nothing like that.",Confusion or memory loss?
5528,No.,Headaches?
5529,No headaches.,"Uh, joint pain?"
5530,No.,Fatigue?
5531,"Uh, no.","Um, changes in your bowel movements?"
5532,"Uh, no. Not at all.","No, changes in your urine?"
5533,Nope.,"Uh, nausea or vomiting?"
5534,No nausea or vomiting.,"OK, how about abdominal pain?"
5535,"No, nothing like that.","OK, are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any longstanding medical conditions?"
5536,"Yeah no, I'm otherwise I um I don't, I'm really healthy. I don't take any medications so this was something that happened out of the blue.","OK, any um hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?"
5537,No.,"No, um medications, are you on any?"
5538,"No, I haven't um tried any medications.",OK. Um are you up to date with all your immunizations?
5539,"Uh I I've been yeah, pretty up to date with all my immunizations.","OK, uh, allergies, do you have any?"
5540,No.,"Sorry, forgot to ask, immunizations. Did you get the flu shot this year?"
5541,Yeah I did.,"OK, good. Any family history of lung conditions?"
5542,"No, not at all.","No, any lung cancers?"
5543,No.,"No, OK. Do you smoke?"
5544,"No, I have never smoked a day in my life.","OK, recreational drugs?"
5545,No I would never take drugs.,OK. Do you drink alcohol?
5546,"No, no, not at all.",OK. Um where do you live right now?
5547,"So I I just live in a small apartment by myself, uh just been moving around a lot.","OK, for sure. Um any like asbestos, mold, or like old carpets, dust, anything like that at your apartment?"
5548,"No, I don't think so.","No, any sick contacts recently?"
5549,"Um not uh, I don't think so like we um, maybe in the Philippines, we do provide a, so I go on like these mission trips with the Church and um we do sometimes go to the hospital as well.",OK.
5550,"Sometimes yeah, we we do see some sick people.","Mhmm, OK."
5551,"But other than that, not since I've been here, no.",Any travel outside the Philippines recently?
5552,"Uhm, so I think. So this year has just been the Philippines, before I used to go to India as well. Um but recently nothing outside of the Philippines.","OK. OK, um those were all the questions that I had for you. Do you have any questions for me?"
5553,"Yeah, I I was very worried um uh about the blood. I was just reading some things up and uh, about tuberculosis, so I was really stressed out today.","Yeah so um, that's definitely high on our differential. So, we'll do a couple of things. We'll do a Covid swab on you um just to rule that in or out, you should hear back for, about those results, in 24 to 48 hours. While you're here in the hospital, we're also going to do a chest X-Ray and or like an AFB smear to see if you have active TB or latent TB. If those come back positive um we will require you to isolate because this uh, because TB is highly infectious and it's airborne. Um so we have a couple of uh, we have like a regimen that we'd put you on. It's called the RIPE medications that we keep you on for two months and then we continue a couple of those for another four months. Um but we will uh keep you here until we have more answers on um like from this TB standpoint. How does that sound?"
5554,"Yeah, that sounds good. Um yeah I'm really worried, but hopefully it's not TB.","Yeah, hopefully it's not, um but if it is, it's it's OK, like um we'll get infectious disease involved. Uh we'll get the isolation going and we'll get you on the correct treatment."
5555,"OK, thank you so much.","Yeah, no problem."
5556,Hi I'm coming in because I've had this like on and off runny nose and stuffy nose for the past week. Um and I just came to make sure it's not something serious like Covid.,"OK, yeah no I completely understand why you might be worried um with everything going on. So just to get an idea of the timeline, so when did this start?"
5557,"So it started about I'd say, seven days ago.","Seven days ago, OK. And was it just a runny nose that started or did you have any other symptoms?"
5558,So at first I felt kind of stuffy um and then now it's more runny. Um and no other symptoms.,And are you coughing at all?
5559,No.,"Are you bringing up any discharge from like your nose, or are you coughing any material up?"
5560,"No, no. I mean there's some discharge from my nose, like it's runny, but it's it's not yellow or anything, it's clear.","OK, and do you think this issue has gone worse over the last seven days or is it improving at all?"
5561,"Um I don't think it's improving. It's changed 'cause it used to be stuffy, now it's more of a runny nose. Um but yeah, it seems to be runny, like it's the same amount of runniness for the past couple of days.",And are you having any symptoms of loss of smell at all?
5562,"No, no loss of smell.",How about loss of taste?
5563,No.,Um were you uh with anyone around you sick at all before those seven days?
5564,"Uh I don't think so, I visited my sister and she has a nephew who goes to daycare, but my nephew's been OK, no, no runny nose or stuffy nose.","Uhm, and is it just a constant issue that goes on throughout the day or is it worse at night, during the day, how would you describe it?"
5565,Um it's it's pretty constant throughout the day. It's just it just feels bad at night because it um makes it hard for me to fall asleep.,"OK, uh have you tried any medications at all over the counter that would help?"
5566,Um I tried some antihistamines because I do have seasonal allergies. Uh but they don't seem to be helping.,"Um any anything that makes your symptoms worse at all, like any exertion or any kind of uh position?"
5567,No.,Um do you have any shortness of breath or chest pain at all?
5568,Uh no.,Any sore throat or muscle aches?
5569,No.,Any uh headaches?
5570,Nope.,Have you traveled at all recently?

5575,"Uh no, nothing like that.",Any changes in your bowel movements like any constipation or diarrhea?
5576,No.,Any changes in your urinary pattern?
5577,No.,Uh any issues with your sleep or appetite?
5578,No.,"Have you lost any weight, significant weight, uh recently in the last few months?"
5579,No.,"And uh do you have any exposure to like fumes, dust, or like uh carpet, pets, or animals? Anything that you might have an allergic reaction to?"
5580,Uh no nothing like that.,OK and currently are you sexually active?
5581,I am.,And um can you just tell me a little a little bit of a detail like about like a partner? Uh and if you've had any new partners recently at all?

5585,No.,Are you allergic to any medications?
5586,Uh not medications.,Uh any environmental allergies?
5587,"Just yeah, some seasonal allergies.",OK. Any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?
5588,Um I was hospitalized for um Like an appendectomy when I was younger. Um but that's about it.,And when was that?
5589,That was when I was 18.,And any complications after that?
5590,No.,"And uh in terms of your family history, does anyone have any lung conditions, heart conditions, or any cancers?"
5591,"Uh nope, nothing like that.",And currently uh do you work?

5594,Uh no.,Do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana?
5595,No.,How about uh any alcohol?
5596,Uh I drink like a glass of wine every other day.,"OK. Um yeah, so those were some of the questions I had for you. I know it's a bit concerning because of the pandemic going on and um a runny nose can be a symptom uh of Covid as well, but uh it can also be a symptom of just the common cold or any other virus. Um but since you're having, uh you're symptomatic right now, we will definitely get like a Covid swab test done for you."
5597,OK.,"And if you start having any, just monitor for your symptoms. Um you should have the test back within 48 hours. Until then, uh at least for 14 days you should try to isolate in your own room, wear a mask around uh your partner, uh and not go outside, so just self isolate."
5598,OK.,"And and then you will get the test results back in a, hopefully in a few days. So do you have any questions at all?"
5599,"Uh no, thank you, that was good.","Take care, bye"
5600,"Um yeah, so I brought my 7 year old daughter here um because she's been coughing uh a lot over the past two weeks. Um she's she sounds wheezy and I'm not too sure what's going on with her so, she's been off school um 'cause they think it's Covid. Uh we got her swab, but because she still has symptoms she can't go back to school, so here she is.","OK, um and when did the cough start?"
5601,It started two weeks ago.,"OK, and when did the wheezing start?"
5602,Um that started about the same time like I should I should mention she does have like episodes like this. Um she's had episodes like this for the past like 2 years uh but they usually go away in a couple of days. But this time it's it's taking a lot like a lot longer to go away.,"OK, so it's been uh has been more than a week, you said?"
5603,"Yeah, it's been close to two weeks now.","Two weeks, OK. And uh were these symptoms brought on by, are they usually brought on by any kind of like activities or can they come up just by themselves?"
5604,"I find it's usually worse in the winter um and if she's like doing some sort of uh like extensive physical activity, so if she's like playing tag and she's running around a lot. Um or if she's like at her gym class and they're running.","OK, and the cough that she's having is it like a wet cough or is it a is it a dry cough?"
5605,It's a dry cough.,"OK, and at all, is she bringing up any yellowish or white uh or green material or any blood at all?"

5610,"Uh I can't, you know, I can't tell, it comes and goes so in that sense, it's been pretty constant. Um there hasn't been a day when she hasn't had these symptoms.","OK, and do they get worse at night at all or are they um the same throughout the day?"
5611,"Uh yeah, now that I think about it, when she's laying down she does have a hard time.","OK. And is she having any other symptoms at all, like uh shortness of breath, um or sore throat?Anything like that?"
5612,"Uh, no sore throat. She sounds wheezy, so she might have like some difficulty breathing, but she doesn't sound short of breath.","OK, and any kind of uh runny nose or any other symptoms at all?"
5613,No.,"No, OK. Uh anything that helps her or makes her symptoms better?"

5620,"Um no, no it doesn't wake her up at night. It just makes it hard for her to fall asleep.","I see. Is she getting enough sleep? Like how, how, how many hours would you say on average she's getting per day?"
5621,I'd say she's getting about 6 to 7 hours. She used to sleep about 8 hours before.,"OK, um and is she having any changes in her appetite at all?"
5622,"Um I don't think so, no.",No?
5623,No.,Um any kind of changes in her weight at all over the past few months?
5624,"I haven't checked over the past month, but before that no, no changes.","No changes, OK. And um has she been, she had like a cold or anything like that recently?"
5625,"No, not that I can think of.","OK, has she been around anyone that's been sick recently?"
5626,No.,OK. Um does she have any past history of any medical conditions at all?
5627,"Uh no, no, nothing like that.",OK and um does she have any uh allergies to any medications or any environmental allergies?
5628,I think she might have some environmental allergies. We haven't gotten her officially tested though.,OK. And um has she had any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?
5629,"When she was a baby, when she was first born, she was hospitalized um for something about having like uh not fully developed lungs.","OK and uhm, was she premature at all? Or was she born after uh, at term?"
5630,"She was slightly premature, I believe she's 34 weeks.","34 weeks, OK. And um was it a vaginal delivery or was it a C-section?"
5631,Uh it was vaginal.,"Vaginal, OK. Were there any uh complications during the pregnancy or after she was born? C"
5632,Um no complications after besides the hospitalization for the small lungs.,"OK. And is there any family history of any lung conditions, heart conditions, or cancers?"
5633,"Uh nope, nothing like that.","Has anyone in the family have, had any kind of asthma, eczema, anything like that?"
5634,Um no.,"No, OK. Um so, and in terms of like at school, are there any kind of complaints uh and any um issues with her development over the last last few years?"
5635,"No, nothing like that.","OK, so she's been growing well?"
5636,"Yeah, she's been growing well. She's been gaining weight like a normal amount um and she's doing well, she was doing well at school.","OK. And um at home, uh what is the environment like?"
5637,"Um she lives at home with both of us like um her mom and her dad, and uh she has a younger sibling who is 4 years old.",OK. And um does anyone smoke in the house at all?
5638,"Um no, not anymore.","OK, um how long ago uh did someone smoke?"
5639,"Um it was, um so her dad used to smoke um and he stopped when she was like 3.","OK, that's good. Um any kind of uh dust or mold or animals, uh anything in the household?"
5640,"No, we don't have any pets and um the place is just renovated so nothing like that.","OK. Alright, so yeah, those were just some of the questions that I had for her today. Do you have any questions or concerns?"
5641,"Um yeah, so what can we do for her right now to make these symptoms go away?","Yeah, so what we should do for her right now is, she's seven years old, um what I'm thinking right now with her symptoms especially coming on after uh exertion, being worse in the winter, she may have asthma."
5642,OK.,"And although she doesn't have any family history of it, it can happen without family history as well. Um so we would like to uh try and do uh what's called a pulmonary function test. That will help us kind of understand uh if she has um asthma or not and then we can try her on um, it's called a short acting beta agonist, so it's a puffer."
5643,OK.,"And uh usually when she gets these types of symptoms, she can use the puffer to help her. Uh and if it um helps her then it's most likely that she does have asthma and she will need um that puffer and then she might also need another puffer, which is an inhaled corticosteroid, um for the future to decrease um the likelihood that this asthma gets worse in the future."
5644,"OK, OK yeah thank you.","Yeah, no worries. So yeah, so yeah we'll get those tests done and then go from there."
5645,"OK, sounds great.",Take care.

5651,"Um, it's mostly like centre of my chest, like, close to my, like I'd say it's like it feels like, it's not my like, it doesn't feel like it's inside. It feels more like it's pushing up on, on my chest wall.","Okay, I see. And is it related to you taking deep breaths at all?"

5695,"Um, yeah like what, do you think I have COVID?","Yeah so, right now it's definitely something that's on everyone's mind. Um some of these symptoms, um the shortness of breath and fever, definitely can be COVID, and that's something that we are going to test you with, and that's something we test everyone with. Um, but because you're having shortness of breath, uh, we do need to make sure nothing else is going on as well. Uh you can potentially have pneumonia that's not COVID, it can be any other virus or bacteria, so we will get some blood work done, we'll get your temperature and all your vitals taken as well, um and then get a chest x-ray as well."
5696,Okay.,"And if it turns out at all that you have pneumonia, we'll just reassess and see if you need to stay in the hospital for longer, if you need any antibiotics within the hospital, or you can take them at home.

5701,"No, no, it's, it's pretty, it's pretty dry.","Okay. Um, and any other symptoms at all, besides the cough?"
5702,"No, nothing else.","Okay, and have you been sick at all recently with fever, chills, runny nose, um any cold like symptoms?"

5704,No.,"Okay, and has this happened to you before at all? Like a cough lasting more than four days?"
5705,"Yeah, it's happened to me in the past. Um, yeah it, yeah it has. Um, but it's just more bothersome this time cause I'm coughing a lot more.","Okay, and is there anything that you've tried that has helped you relieve the cough at all?"
5706,"I tried some over-the-counter cough suppressants. Uh, they don't seem to be working too well.","I see, and anything that's making your cough worse at all? No?"

5729,Thank you.,"Besides uh, like smoking, um do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana?"
5730,No.,"No, okay. And how about alcohol?"
5731,"Nope, I don't drink too much alcohol. I drink like over the Holidays.","Okay. And I forgot to ask you this earlier, but any hospitalization or surgeries in the past?"
5732,"No, nothing like that.","Nothing like that, okay. Those are all the questions, um, I have for you. Do you have any questions or concerns?"
5733,"Um, yeah, what should I do about this cough?","Yeah, so this cough, um, it's been going on for the last four days. Since you do have a cough, um and right now that, like, is considered a symptom, like, like a potential symptom for COVID, we definitely want to do a COVID swab test for you, which will come back in 24 hours to 48 hours. You should still try and isolate as much as you can away from any roommates, or family members for the next, so, 14 days since you first experienced the, the cough."
5734,Okay.,"Based on, like, public health will call you as well so you can follow their instructions. And if, it can be anything else too, like, with a cough, there can be multiple things going on. You can have um, like an upper respiratory, viral, or bacterial infection. But since you're not having too many other symptoms right now, it can just be bronchitis. Um, this is something that we'll try and keep an eye on and make sure it's nothing else like, uh pneumonia, for example. But right now, yeah, we'll get that testing done and then just, kind of wait and watch."
5735,"Sure, yeah. Thank you.","You're welcome, take care."
5736,"Uh, yeah, so I, I just came in because I've been having, for the last, I would say 2 weeks, just a lot of congestion in my nose and then I've also been feeling a lot of pressure in my head as well as just, around my jaws and my face overall.","Okay, and um, you said it started two weeks ago. Has it gotten better or worse, or been the same since then?"
5737,"Um, I'd say it's pretty much been the same, except like the pressure's getting worse.","Okay, and do you find that the pressure is worse when you're bending down, or um, yeah, when you're like squatting or sitting down?"
5738,"Um, when I'm sitting down, I don't think so, but like sometimes I do feel like, for example, when I'm lying on one side, it gets really bad on that one side and I have to kind of switch over to the other side.","Okay, alright. And uh, when did your headaches start?"
5739,"Um it's, I guess it's not so much as a headache as just kind of um, just pain in and around the cheeks and just going up to my head. And it started about, I would say around 2 weeks ago.","Um, and do you have a stuffy nose?"
5740,"Yeah, I definitely have a stuffy nose and it started, um, it sometimes gets like, like a runny nose as well.","Yeah, okay and what's the discharge like?"
5741,Uh it's usually clear.,"Okay, and do you have a cough?"
5742,"No, no coughs.",Sore throat?
5743,No.,"Um, and do you have any difficulties breathing?"
5744,"Um, no, not that I've noticed. Sometimes when it gets really stuffy, I, uh, have to breathe through my mouth.","Yeah, I see. Do you have any difficulty swallowing?"
5745,"Uh, no.","Any chest pain or any heart, um, palpitations?"
5746,Nope.,"Um, any pain in your belly?"

5751,Nope.,"Um, any fevers or chills?"
5752,"No, not that I've noticed.","Any weight, changes in your weight recently?"
5753,"No, no changes.","Any uh, night sweats?"
5754,"Uh, no.","Okay. Um, alright so, have you had any contact with anyone who could have been sick in the past two weeks or before that?"
5755,"No, no, I'm very like careful. Um, I barely go out.","Good, that's very good. Um are you, have you traveled anywhere outside the province?"
5756,No.,"Okay and um, do you currently work?"
5757,"I work from home right now, um, I'm an accountant.","Okay and do you live with anyone else, or do you live alone?"
5758,"Uh, so I live with my family. I live with my husband and um two daughters.",Have any of them been sick recently?
5759,"No, they've been fine.","Okay, good. Um, and do you smoke?"
5760,"No, not at all.",Do you smoke marijuana or consume any recreational drugs?
5761,"Probably the last time was in college, um for marijuana.","I see. Um, what about alcohol?"
5762,"Alcohol, I'll probably have a glass of red wine a day.","Alright, okay. And um, have you, do you have any, um I guess carpets or, or um curtains or any sort of animals around, anything that might cause any kind of environmental allergies?"
5763,"Uh no, nothing like that.","Okay, um alright. And do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?"
5764,"No, I've been completely healthy.",Any hospitalizations or surgeries?
5765,"I did have a, um, c-section with both my, both my children.",I see. Any complications after?
5766,"No complications after. They were both healthy, I, I didn't have to stay in the hospital.","Great, great. Um and any allergies uh to medications, foods or environmental allergies?"
5767,"Nope, not that I know of.","Any medications, including over the counter herbal medications?"
5768,"I have uh, I do take uh, Tylenol cold in bed sometimes, to relieve some of the pain and pressure.","That's good, that's good. Is there anything else that makes the the pressure and the pain better?"
5769,"Um, I have done those like, kind of those steam um, therapies. That sometimes helps.","Okay good, good, good. Um, any uh, anything that makes the, that makes it worse? I know that lying on one side, you said, makes things worse for you. Anything else that's made the pressure worse?"
5770,"Um, no, I would say that's, that's about it.","Okay, any changes in your sense of smell?"
5771,"Yeah, definitely. Uh when I get really stuff, stuffy, like I don't really smell anything.",What about sense of taste?
5772,"Um taste, I guess, like with the smell gone sometimes like the taste feels weird too, but like not, not really.","I see, okay. Um, and any family history of any medical conditions?"
5773,"Um my, my father did have a heart attack in his uh, I think it was late 50s, but he's well and alive right now, so he's fine.","Good. Alright, well that's all the questions I had for you given the symptoms that you've shared with me, it sounds like you might have something called um, rhinosinusitis, uh which is basically inflammation of the sinuses and of the uh, of the nasal cavity or the area inside your nose, and uh, often it's just treated with conservative management, so just continue to take um, Tylenol if that seems to help you, and do the steam therapy. It will take time to get better, um, but if you feel that it's um, it's not getting better in the next week or so, give us a call again and we can maybe see if it's a bacterial infection and see if um, if antibiotics might be needed but oftentimes it's usually a viral infection, and antibiotics are not needed, and sort of just resting and taking care of yourself, um, and trying to manage the symptoms that way can help. Um, but also check your temperature here to see if you have any fevers and uh, go from there. We'll also, I guess, we'll also do a COVID swab because your symptoms do overlap with some of those symptoms. Um, and we'd recommend that you quarantine until at least uh swabs, swab results are out and then public health will let you know what to do."
5774,Okay.,Do you have any questions for me?
5775,"Uh no, that's all. Thank you so much.",You're welcome.
5776,"So I've been, just over the last week, I've been feeling pretty sick. I have this pretty bad headache that started like probably a week ago, and then for the last few days I've been having these chills. Um, and I didn't get a chance to measure my temperature at all, um, but the worst thing has been just these muscle aches all over my body, and that's been going on for the last three to four days.","Sorry to hear that you're feeling so, uh, horrible over the past week. Um let's uh, let's try to understand this a little bit better. So you've had this headache for the past week or so. Where exactly is it?"
5777,"It's kind of just uh, all across my forehead. It's been going to the sides, like into my temples as well.","Okay, and what does it feel like? How would you describe it?"
5778,"Uh yeah, it feels like, kind of like uh aching um, I, I have had headaches with throbbing before, but it's not so much throbbing it's more just constant, aching pain.","Um, if you had to give it a number from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst um, pain ever, what number would you give it?"
5779,"Uh, probably like a 7.","Oh wow, yeah, that sounds severe. How long have you, how long has it been a 7 for?"
5780,"Um, it's actually a bit better now, but yeah, like over the last week it's been a 7. I would say now, it's probably around 5.","Okay. Um, anything that makes the headache better?"
5781,"Um I, I take like Tylenol, then like, it gets relieved for a bit, for like a few hours, and then comes back.","Anything that you feel makes the headaches worse? Any postures, or positions, or activity or um, any kind of exposure to light or sounds?"
5782,"Uh no it's, it's just kind of there. Nothing makes it worse.",Do you have nausea or vomiting?
5783,"Uh no, no nausea or vomiting.",No. Any sensitivity to light or sounds?
5784,No.,"Okay. Uh, and is it only, is it only on one, on one side of your head or forehead, or is it on both sides?"
5785,"Uh it, it seems like it's on both sides.",And have you noticed any visual changes? Any blurry vision with the headaches?
5786,No.,"Any other visual changes? No, okay. Um, and you've also had chills, but you said you haven't checked your temperature, right?"
5787,"No, I haven't, uh, I've been having chills for the last few nights.","Yeah, we can definitely check your temperature here in the, um here. Um, and you mentioned that the muscle aches have been quite bothersome for you. Is it all over your body or anyone, uh, in any one muscle group?"
5788,It seems like it's all over.,"Okay, okay. And um, I'll ask you about a couple other symptoms just to rule out um, any other issues that you might be having. So have you noticed that you've been confused at all over the past few days?"
5789,"Uh no, I don't think so.",Have you had any like stiffness or rigidity in your neck?
5790,"Maybe a little bit of a stiffness in, in my neck.",Okay.
5791,"Then like I, I don't know if that's just the muscle pain. It's like kind of on my upper back, lower neck area.","We can definitely um, examine that, um, when I'm doing physical examine and see how that is. Um, okay, and uh, have you had any, um, redness in your eyes, or any teary eyes?"
5792,"No, nothing like that.","Do the headaches come and go, or is it always there?"
5793,"Uh, they're pretty much like constant throughout the day.","Um, and do you have a runny nose or stuffy nose?"
5794,"Uh no, no I don't I, I think I'm kind of, I'm developing a little cough though.","Okay, when did that start?"

5798,No.,"Uh, any chest pain?"
5799,No.,Any difficulties with breathing?
5800,"Uh, no.","Any palpitations, or feel like your heart's beating very fast?"
5801,No.,"Okay, any belly pain?"

5807,"Um, I haven't noticed, but I, I do go to work, um, and we recently switched to like in person instead of I, I used to do um, home work, but for the last month I've been going into the office.","I see, and have you been wearing a mask?"
5808,"Yeah, well I try to wear the mask. Sometimes like uh, in the, in the stock, like lounge, we like take take off the mask to eat and stuff but that's about it.",Are you maintaining social distancing when you're taking your mask off?
5809,"Yeah, it's uh, most of the times we're pretty socially distanced when we're eating, but sometimes it's like hard to control when you know, when you're going near the microwave to heat up your food, and sometimes it gets hard. It's a, it's a fairly small room, so.","Yeah, well I would, I would recommend that you try to eat when people are not in the room if possible because you are putting yourself at risk.  Like if it's a small room, I think you should also talk to management or try to limit the number of people who can be in the room at a time. Um, for your own safety, you know, and for the safety of others uh, working with you. Um okay, and um, have you traveled anywhere recently?"
5810,"No, we've been uh, at home.","Okay, good, um, and who do you live with?"
5811,"I live with my young, like uh, daughter and then my wife as well.","Okay, and you, do you think they might have got any contacts to anyone who is sick?"
5812,"Uh no, they've been completely fine. Uh, my daughter is like, is uh, doing school from home right now, so she's not really seeing anyone.","Okay, that's good. And um, do you currently smoke?"
5813,"I do, I do smoke um, probably half a pack a day.",For how long?
5814,"Um, for probably the last 20 years.","Okay, and do you uh, consume marijuana?"
5815,"Just um, maybe once or twice a month.",Okay.
5816,"Just uh, sometimes, it helps me sleep sometimes.","Sure. Do you take any recreational drugs like cocaine, amphetamine, LSD, ecstasy, etc.?"
5817,"No, nothing like that.",Any alcohol?
5818,"Yeah, I drink probably uh, a beer or two every couple days.","Alright, and uh, do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?"
5819,"Uh yeah, so I do, they're saying I might have um, high blood pressure. Um they like, it, it's still ongoing. Um they're testing, testing me for things.","Sure yeah, and have you uh, taken any medications for it?"
5820,"No, not yet, I haven't been put on any medications.","Have you, do you take anything over the counter? Any herbal pills, vitamins, minerals, etc.?"
5821,No.,"Okay, and do you have any allergies?"
5822,No allergies.,"Okay, good. Um, and have you had any surgeries in the past or any hospitalizations?"
5823,"Um I was pretty young, I had my tonsils removed um, but other than that no no other surgeries or hospitalizations.",Good. Any family history of any medical conditions?
5824,"Um, so I think my mother, she, she has like type 2 diabetes.",Okay.
5825,"And uh, my father has been pretty healthy, like no issues with him.","Good. Um, okay, have you had any um, have you had migraines in the past?"
5826,"Um, yeah, sometimes I, when I'm like stressed at work and like I uh, it's not like anything regular that happens to me. I probably have had migraines in the past.","Okay, okay, and have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or um, with uh, COPD?"
5827,No.,"Okay, alright, um so it sounds like you've had a headache for the past week, which has been kind of constant, about 7 out of 10. And then you've also developed a fever, but you haven't, or I guess you've been feeling, you've been having chills uh, and we can measure temperature here, and you also had a cough that started yesterday. What about um, sense of taste? Have you noticed any changes there?"
5828,"Uh, no, not that I've really noticed.",What about your sense of smell?
5829,"Um, my smell, I don't think so, but like sometimes I do feel a bit, like stuffy as well. Like not, not right now, but before when I felt stuffy I lost my sense of smell.","Sure, yeah, okay. Um, okay well that's all the questions I have for you. We'll do a physical exam um, get a chest x-ray done, also examine your neck as well a little bit, just to make sure there's no stiffness or rigidity, have a look inside your mouth, um, listen to your chest."
5830,Okay.,"We will also get a COVID swab done, simply because your symptoms sound very similar to um, or I guess a lot of these symptoms do overlap with symptoms of COVID, so we'll do that. And um, I would require, would request that you continue to uh, stay at home if you haven't been doing so so far. Um, take a leave from work, try to do work from home, and quarantine at home as much as possible and stay away from your wife and your daughter as well, at least until the swab is back and you get some more guidance from uh, public health. If it is positive, they will give you a call. Um, there are lots of guidelines on how to self isolate and I, I can share that with you. Um, it's best that you do that for now. Um, we will run a couple of tests, do labs, and based on those results, uh, we'll decide if you need to stay in the ER or if we can um, if you can be discharged later today. Do you have any questions for me?"
5831,"Uh no that, that all sounds great. Thanks for explaining it to me.",You're welcome.
5832,"Uh yeah, hi, I just came in here today cause uh, lately, for the last couple of months, I've been getting these coughing fits. They don't really seem to be going away and I was a bit concerned.","So you've had this, when did this start?"
5833,"Uh, I would say probably during the winter uh it, it kind of started, where I started having um, just coughing fits when I'm walking to school and then also during like gym class I started having these coughing fits and sometimes I also felt like I couldn't breathe.","Um, okay. Okay, what did you, is there anything, so it's basically worse when you're um, doing some sort of an exercise such as walking um, or being in the gym class, and it's also worse in the cold?"
5834,"Yeah. Yeah, and then also like, I remember when I was walking down the street and someone was smoking and then I just completely just started having that episode right after I walked past them.","Okay um, alright. Uh um okay, sorry, one moment. Okay um, so is there anything that makes your cough better? What do you do to make it go away?"
5835,"Uh, I just basically have to, if I, if I'm doing any kind of activities, just take a moment, sit down for like 10 to 15 minutes and then it seems like it goes away on its own.",And you said that sometimes you also have difficulties breathing with it?
5836,"Yeah, like a couple of times it got really bad where I had to um like, it was difficult get, it was, it was like I was trying to take deep breaths for air, but uh it was, it just felt like I couldn't.","I see. So this started a couple of months ago, has this ever happened to you before that?"
5837,"No, before that I've been fine.","Okay, and so I'm going to ask you about a couple other symptoms. Let me know if you've experienced any of these in the past couple of months. Um, so have you had a headache that accompanies the cough?"
5838,Uh no.,"Um, any changes in your vision or your hearing?"
5839,No.,Any confusion?
5840,No.,"Um any, um, runny nose or stuffy nose or sinus congestion?"
5841,"Uh no, not really.","Okay, any sore throat?"
5842,Uh no.,"Any um, chest pain?"
5843,"Um, sometimes when I get like really bad coughing fits, like it sometimes starts hurting in my chest as well.","Yeah. Um, does it go away when you stop coughing?"
5844,"Yeah, it goes away after, I just take some rest.","Um, have you had any belly pain?"
5845,"Uh no, not at all.",Do you feel like your heart's racing?
5846,"Uh, no.","Any changes in your, any nausea or vomiting?"
5847,No.,Any changes in your bowel movements?
5848,No.,Any acid reflux?
5849,"Uh, no.","Okay, um, and any certain muscle aches or joint pains?"
5850,"Um no, nothing like that.",Any numbness or tingling in your arms or legs?
5851,No.,"Okay, let's get back. Okay, great, it sounds like that the, the cough is sort of the main symptom here that you have. Um, is the cough dry or wet?"
5852,"It's usually uh, it's usually dry.","Uh sorry, can you say that again?"
5853,It's usually dry.,"Okay um, have you ever brought up any sputum or any blood?"
5854,"Uh never any blood, I have like on occasion, like sometimes brought up some sputum.","Okay, alright. Um okay, and, uh, have you been vaccinated?"
5855,"Uh, yeah, all my immunizations are up to date.","Okay, good good good. Um, does the cough sound like a barky cough or a muffled cough, or um, does it have a specific characteristic? Does it sound different than when you're sort of coughing to clear your throat, for instance?"
5856,"Uh yeah, it's like pretty, it can get pretty harsh. I also noticed like uh, there's like this weird noise I started making like right after when I'm trying to take deep breaths in.","Okay, okay. Okay, so you're wheezing. Okay, so you ever um, cough so much that you end up vomiting?"
5857,"No, no that hasn't happen yet.","Um, and do you, so you mentioned that it's worse when you're in the cold or exercising, and smoking makes it worse? What about things like dust or pollen? Um, say when you're cleaning the house and there's also dust, does that make things worse, or is it worse in a specific time of the year when you're outdoors?"
5858,"Uh, now that you mention it, yeah, like if we're ever in the basement or anything like that, I, I do start getting like kind of irritation um, in my throat, and that kind of, sometimes I have also coughed at those times.","Alright. Uh, can you tell me, okay so, can you tell me if you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?"
5859,"No, nothing else, I've been pretty healthy.","Okay. Had, did, when you were a child, did you have any sort of rash? Did you have eczema?"
5860,"Oh I, yeah, so I did I, at one point I was using like this cream um, probably when I was ten. Just for some eczema on my hands.","Okay. And um, have you ever had allergic rhinitis, which is basically sort of having um, red or teary eyes, itchiness on the face, a runny nose at certain times of the year, or in um, areas with mold or dust, or termites and things like that? Have you had anything like that as a child or right now?"
5861,"Uh, not that I know of, no.","Okay. Alright, uh do you have any, um, I guess going back, were you a healthy child, growing up?"
5862,"Yeah, as far as I know, I, I didn't really have any concerns from like the school or home at all.","Okay, that's great. Do you uh, did you ever have any hospitalizations?"
5863,No.,Any surgeries?
5864,No.,Are you taking any medications?
5865,"Uh, no medications.",Are you still using the eczema cream?
5866,"No, no. That kind of just went away on its own, or like right after I used the cream. Like it's good now.","Okay, good. Are you allergic to anything?"
5867,"No, I don't think so. Maybe just like environmental allergies sometimes, in the springtime.",What happens then?
5868,"Um, just sometimes like uh, I don't know if it's like a pollen allergy like I, I do get some, I guess I do get like some nasal congestion and things like that.","Um, have you ever seen an allergist?"
5869,"No, I haven't.","No. Uh, who prescribed the cream for the eczema?"
5870,"Um, just a, it was like at a walk-in clinic.","Okay, okay. Um alright, and do you have any family history of any um, lung-related problems? Or any other problems?"
5871,"Um, my older sister has asthma, and uh, I don't know if anyone else in the family has asthma. Um, I think my father has high blood pressure.","Alright, and you mentioned that things are going well at school. Um, who do you live with at home?"
5872,"Yeah so I live with my older sister, and my mom and dad.","Okay, okay. And things are good at home? Do you feel safe?"
5873,"Yeah, yeah, I feel completely safe.",Any concerns about bullying at school?
5874,"No, no, not at all.","Okay are you uh, are you taking any marijuana or any street drugs?"
5875,"No, no, my parents would kill me.",What about alcohol?
5876,"Uh, I'll come, I've, I haven't tried it um, yet, at all.","Okay, okay. Just wanted to mention that the conversation that we're having right now is confidential between you and me. Um, unless you mentioned anything that harms you or harms anyone else so, so feel free to discuss whatever or talk openly about um, any issues that you have. Um, okay, and um, are you sexually active?"
5877,"No, no.","Alright, okay. So um, that's all the information I needed. Uh given that you've had these coughing fits for the past couple of months that are, that have certain triggers, uh, and also given that you've had a history of eczema, and your sister has asthma, so kind of, sort of runs in your family in a way. You might also have a diagnosis of asthma potentially. Um, and so, what I would recommend is that you get um, testing done and um, uh I guess before I sort of talk a little more about this, I just want to get a sense of how severe your asthma, if it's asthma at all, um if, does it, does it affect your ability to, you said school was going okay, does it affect your ability to do well at school at all?"
5878,"Um definitely in, in gym class, but other than that it hasn't really affected me.",Does it wake you up at night?
5879,"No, so far no. I, I like, I get pretty good sleep.","Okay, okay. Um, and how often, I guess is, do these episodes occur? How many times a week, or how many times a month?"
5880,"Uh, so they just started like two months ago, and I've had like maybe four or five of them in total.","Okay, okay. Uh, and they kind of get better on their own. Okay, so we can sort of talk about these, sorry, puffers that you might need to, to use as needed. Um, your sister might have some of those, so you might be familiar with what I'm talking about."
5881,Yeah.,"Um, so we can talk about that. Um, given that your symptoms are, yes, they've been occurring for the past couple of months, but because you have had a cough, it might be a good idea just to have a COVID test done once. Um, I don't think that's what you have, seeing that this, these symptoms have been lasting for, have been occurring for the past two months, so we'll just kind of do that test to rule it out. Um, in the meantime, I would recommend that you um, try this inhaled corticosteroid puffer that you can use, that you should use on a daily basis, and try to avoid uh, the triggers. So the things that you, that cause these symptoms. Um, we can go over how to use uh, a puffer properly and I will also give you a spacer, which will help deliver most of that medication in the, uh, to your lungs. Do you have any questions?"
5882,"Hi, I'm um, I'm just, so I am here because I have this cough that I've had for the past um, week and a half, and I'm just uh, I usually don't come in with symptoms this minor, but because it's, because we're in the middle of a pandemic, I thought I should come in and get checked out.","Okay, yeah, so it's been going on for like more than a week. Um, can you describe to me what kind of cough you're having? Is it like a wet cough or a dry cough?"
5883,It's a dry cough.,"Okay, and has it been getting worse over the, over the time period you described?"
5884,"Um, it's kind of the same.","It's the same. Um, have you noticed, although it's like dry, have you brought up any kind of sputum or phlegm at all?"
5885,"Um no, not, not, not recently. But yeah, in the first couple of days, the first two, three days.","Okay, um and have you noticed any kind of yellowish to greenish tinge to it?"
5886,"No, it was watery.","Watery, okay. Have you noticed at all, any blood, have you been coughing up any blood at all?"
5887,"Uh, no.","Okay, and is your cough like constant or does it come and go?"
5888,"Um, kind of comes and goes. There's just times when I'm coughing a lot and then it just goes away.","Okay, and is there a pattern to it? Like, uh, do you cough more when you're exerting yourself or any time, a certain time of the day?"
5889,"Um, it's worse when I'm smoking.","When you're smoking, okay. And uh, how long do those episodes last?"
5890,"Couple of seconds, maybe?","Okay, and has this happened to you before at all?"
5891,"Yeah. I think, um, yeah, I usually don't pay much attention to it. You know, I think must have happened last year or the year before. It just kind of goes away on its own.","Okay, and is there any anything that makes it better or worse?"
5892,"Um, I um, I take this cough syrup, over the counter syrup, that helps.","Okay. And um, have you found that it's been helping over, like, to help improve your cough over the last few days?"
5893,It goes away for a couple hours and then it comes back.,I see. Does it keep keep you up at night at all?
5894,"No, no, no.","No, okay. Are you having any other symptoms like shortness of breath, um sore throat, runny nose, anything like that?"
5895,"Uh, I kind of had those symptoms in those first two, three days, but then it went away, and then I only had this cough that stayed.","Okay, okay. And have you been in contact with anyone that's been sick around you at all?"
5896,"Um, my daughter had the sniffles.",When was that?
5897,"Last, two weeks ago.","Two weeks ago? Okay. And uh, how is she now like, did it just go away on its own, or did she have to go to the doctor?"
5898,"Um, no, it kind of went away on its own.",Okay. Have you traveled at all recently outside of the province or the country?
5899,No.,"No, okay. And besides the cough, are you having any headaches at all?"
5900,No.,Any nausea or vomiting?
5901,No.,Any fevers or chills?
5902,Not anymore.,"Not anymore, when was the last time that you had fevers or chills?"
5903,"I think I had like a very, it must have been 37.4, um, in the first, two, three days. But it got better really quickly.","Okay, I see. Any night sweats?"
5904,No.,"No, okay. Any, um, do you feel tired throughout the day?"
5905,Not anymore.,"Not anymore, okay. So any kind of chest pain, or sensation that your heart is racing?"
5906,No.,No. Any dizziness or fainting spell?
5907,No.,Any changes in your bowel movements at all?
5908,"Um, no.","No, so no constipation, diarrhea?"
5909,No.,"Okay, any changes in your urination?"
5910,No.,"No, okay. Um, have you had to miss work at all or, do you currently work?"
5911,"Yeah, but I've been working from home.",Okay.
5912,"I didn't have to miss work, so.",Okay. And any changes in your sleep or appetite?
5913,No.,"Okay, any loss of sense of taste or smell at all?"
5914,"Um, initially, I guess the cough's first few days, my nose was a little stuffy, so yeah, I couldn't smell very well, but since then it's been fine.","Okay, but no loss of taste?"
5915,"No loss of taste, no.","Okay. Uh, any recent significant changes to your weight at all over the last few months?"
5916,No.,"Okay, um, and any exposure in your home environment to dust, fumes? Any animals in the household?"
5917,No.,"Okay. And otherwise, uh, do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?"
5918,"Uh no, I'm pretty healthy.","Pretty healthy, okay. Any allergies, either to medications or environmental?"
5919,"Um, I'm allergic to penicillin.","To penicillin, okay. And what kind of reaction do you get to penicillin?"
5920,"Um, I was told that I got a rash when I was a child. I don't really remember.","Okay, and do you take any medications on a regular basis?"
5921,No.,"No, okay. And have you been hospitalized in the past or had any surgeries?"
5922,"Um, I had my appendix removed about um, five years ago.","Five years ago, okay. Any complications at all after that?"
5923,No.,"Okay. Any family history of any lung conditions, heart conditions, any cancers at all?"
5924,"Um, colon cancer.",Colon cancer?
5925,Yeah my dad and my grandfather had it.,"Okay, um, and have you, have you had any scopes done recently at all?"
5926,"Oh yeah, I had mine done uh, seven years ago.","Seven years ago, okay. And were there any findings at all?"
5927,No.,"No, okay. Um, currently so you work from home, so what's your home and living situation like? Who do you live with, and where, do you live in like a house, appartment?"
5928,"Uh, I live in an apartment with my wife and my daughter.","Okay uh, and uh, do they have any symptoms at all? Or are they, are they fine?"
5929,"Well, my daughter doesn't have any symptoms anymore. She did as I mentioned, have some flu like symptoms 2 weeks ago. My wife's been healthy.","Okay, and uh, does your daughter go to school right now or is she doing school from home?"
5930,"Uh, school from home.","School from home, okay. Um, and do you at all smoke? So you mentioned your symptoms get worse with smoking."
5931,Yeah.,"Um, how much would you say you smoke on an average day?"
5932,"Um, I don't, I try, I've been trying to cut down, so I, I smoke about 3 or 4 cigarettes a week. I used to smoke a lot more before.","Wow, yeah, that's really good! That's really great progress, um, it's really difficult to quit, but it's great to see that you're trying to quit. Um, so how much would you say you used to smoke?"
5933,"Well, half a pack. Um, half a pack a day, but then over the past three years I've been trying to cut it down. I started smoking when I was 20, so it's been um, 30 years now.","Okay, so 30 years, okay. And um, are you just, are you using anything to help you quit smoking or are you doing it without any medications, or um, like, have you used anything in the past that has worked for you?"
5934,"Um, no I, I went to my doc and he said to try on my own first and if I'm struggling with it to come back, but I've been doing it very gradually so it's, it's going well.","Okay, and that's really good. And yeah, if you, at all, need any resources to help you quit smoking, it's great that you're doing really well, but if you need to talk more about it or need any more resources we can provide that for you. Um, other than uh, smoking cigarettes, do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana at all?"
5935,No.,No. How about alcohol?
5936,"Uh, I just drink on the weekends. Maybe a glass or two of wine.","Okay, and uh yeah. So those were kind of all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns?"
5937,No.,No?
5938,"I was, I guess I was just worried about the cough um, it's just, I was worried that it could be COVID.","Yeah, so definitely right now, any of these symptoms, like COVID can have a lot of different symptoms um, so we should definitely make sure that we, to check if you have COVID or not and we'll get a COVID swab test done for you today, and the results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Uh, and in that time, you will need to isolate even in your own home. Try to wear a mask around your family members, um, trying to eat separately and use all those methods, and, and then after the test comes back you may, you'll be contacted by public health if it's positive and kind of given more instruction on what to do. And it doesn't necessarily have to be COVID either, it can be just another virus uh, like it can be just your common cold that's been going on. So it does seem that your symptoms have gotten better. Oftentimes uh, a cough can be the last thing to go, it can take up to two weeks or more for the cough to get relieved, but it seems that you're not having any systemic symptoms like no fevers or anything else right now, so it's, it's uh, that's, that's pretty good."
5939,"Great, I'm glad.","Alright, yeah."
5940,Thank you.,You're welcome. Take care.
5941,"Hi I am having difficulties breathing and I've just had this cough and it's, It's been two months now.","Two months, so did the two months of the difficulty breathing or the cough?"
5942,Two months of difficulty breathing and the cough is gotten worse. I've had a cough for a couple years now. I'm a smoker.,OK and is is this cough different at all?
5943,"It's just, it just doesn't go away.","OK, and when did the shortness of breath start?"
5944,About two months ago.,"OK, and is it getting worse?"
5945,oh yeah,OK. Are you bringing up any sputum at all with your cough?
5946,"Uhm? I sometimes uhm, yeah I do.",OK and is is there any color to it or is it clear?
5947,it's pink in color,It's pink in color?
5948,Hmm,Ok. Have you coughed up any blood at all?
5949,Sometimes,sometimes?
5950,Streaks of blood here and there.,"Little streaks of blood? OK, and have you ever coughed up any just without without it being in the sputum, just onto a tissue or anything like that? Just coughing up any blood?"
5951,No.,OK. So an are your symptoms just constant over the last two months or do they come and go?
5952,Shortness of breath just kind of stays.,"OK, and is there anything that helps with your shortness of breath, like taking a rest or any positions in particular?"
5953,"Yeah, sometimes resting does help. I find that it's worse when I'm moving around, I'm huffing and puffing more.","OK, and is it worse at all when you lay down?"
5954,No.,No? And do you find yourself ever having to wake up at night and gasp gasping for air?
5955,"No, it hasn't gotten that far but seeing how bad it's been over the past two months and how fast is progressing, I won't be surprised if I can't even sleep. It's been quite difficult I I don't even know why I waited so long. I should have come in earlier.","Well, I'm glad you came in today. We can definitely try and help you with what's going on. Do you at all use any kind of medications to help you with your symptoms?"
5956,I've just been using my inhalers a bit more but they don't always help.,"OK, and what are you using the inhalers for?"
5957,"Oh, I have COPD.","COPD? OK, and when were you diagnosed?"
5958,It's been 15 years now.,15 years and do you know the how many puffers are you taking?
5959,"Uhm, I'm taking uhm, I'm taking two puffers.","OK, and do you have one that that you take when you when you absolutely need it?"
5960,"Yeah, yeah I do. That's the one that I've been trying to use but",Has it been less effective at all recently?
5961,"Yeah, it hasn't been helping. The blue one I tried to keep taking the blue one and it's just, you know it's not helping.","Have you been sick at all recently with fever? Chills, like runny nose? Any cold like symptoms?"
5962,No.,"No, nothing like that? Have you been in contact with anyone that's been sick?"
5963,Oh no. I've been staying at home. I've been very careful these days.,"Yeah for sure. Any so this started two months ago? Are you having, so you have not traveled then I'm assuming?"
5964,No.,"OK, are you having any kind of dizziness or fainting spells?"

Like I'm not gonna live a lot longer anyway.","Yeah yeah but also even if you try to cut down some of your symptoms might get better. Like even though you're 75, you can definitely have improvement in some of your symptoms that you're having, like the shortness of breath and coughing. So if at all that you you want to consider cutting down and gradually. we can talk about that more as well."
6007,Sure,"OK, and do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana?"
6008,No,Do you drink?
6009,No,"No, OK, so yeah, those are all the questions I have for you. Do you have any questions for me?"
6010,"No, I just I guess I need to be admitted right? Just like those other COPD exacerbations? I'm thinking this is exactly that and I'll have to stay in the hospital, right? for a couple of days","Yeah, so we definitely before deciding on whether or not you should be admitted, since you said the Ventolin is not working for you, we will definitely give you some some ventilation and perhaps steroid for just to get rid of some of your symptoms right now, and we want to also make sure since you're having like cough as well as shortness of breath to do a covid swab on you, just in case. I know you've been like isolating and everything, but just in case I will do that and we'll get like a chest x ray on you as well, just to see if there's any kind of pneumonia going on. And then from there we'll also get your blood work, and then from there we'll see whether or not you will require another admission."
6011,Sure.,"OK, and there you might, I'm not 100% sure, but you might require home oxygen if like we take your vitals and everything and your oxygenation is very low. Have you have you been talked about that at all in the past?"
6012,"Yeah, they talked about it last time I've been trying to avoid it, but if it has to happen, it has to happen.","Hmm yeah, and it might just sometimes just, you know you've had four admissions in the past and it might actually just help you stay at home if you are on oxygen. Anyways, yeah we can talk about that. We'll do like a full physical examination everything and go from there."
6013,Sure.,"Great, I'll be with you shortly."
6014,"Hi, I've I've just been. I've been sneezing a lot and I have this runny nose. It's just been very irritating. I kind of want to do something about it. I've had it for awhile, but it's just. You know, I decided to like, come in to find out what's. What's wrong with me? Why do I like? Why does this happen to me? All my friends are OK.","Oh yeah, I know it must be very, very irritating. How long has it been going on for?"
6015,"It's been years, I don't even remember.","Oh years, OK and years like just sneezing and the runny nose has been going on for the last few years."
6016,"Yeah, it kind of kind of comes on like around the spring time. It just gets really bad at that time.","yeah? OK, and are there any besides during the spring time, any kind of allergens or any anything in the house or around you that triggers it, like dust or anything like that?"
6017,"Yeah, dust makes it a lot worse. Like when I have to vacuum the house, I just feel awful for the next two days.","I see, do you get any other symptoms besides the, uh, sneezing and runny nose?"
6018,"Yeah, let my nose so stuffy and sometimes it's just like my eyes and my nose are just itchy and my eyes get like red and teary sometimes. It's so embarrassing when I'm going to school. I also wake up in the morning with this like sore throat and have just cough and clear out my, you know clear my throat.","OK, and does that happen like every morning?"
6019,It's usually worse around springtime.,OK. and are you coughing at all?
6020,"Well, I have to like cough to clear my throat but then not otherwise.","OK, and are you bringing up any sputum?"

6022,"just in the morning,",just in the morning?
6023,Yeah,Do you have a sensation of like anything kind of dripping down your throat like after you wake up like just a build up?
6024,Yeah yeah I do.,"Ok. And besides that, have you been having any symptoms of fevers, chills, sore throat?"
6025,"I get a bit of a sore throat, I guess in the morning, but it just goes away after.","OK,"
6026,But no fevers.,"OK, and is there anything that you've tried at all, like medications or anything that has helped you with these symptoms?"
6027,"Uhm yeah, I tried like umm Reactin and that really helped.",That helped OK that's good and are you taking Reactin right now?
6028,I didn't take it today. I tried it a couple days ago.,OK. And have you traveled at all recently?
6029,No.,"No, OK, and any sick contacts, anyone around you that has been sick?"

6036,No.,Any trouble urinating?
6037,no.,Any changes to your appetite or weight?
6038,"I've been losing weight, but I've been dieting and working out more.","OK, and how much weight would you say you've lost over the last few months?"
6039,"I've lost about four pounds in the past four, five months. It's been hard to lose weight.","And so no, no sudden like loss of weight or anything like that right now?"
6040,"No, no, no","Well, it's really great that you're, you know, trying to lose weight and dieting and and having like a healthier lifestyle. It is definitely harder with the pandemic going on right now to to get in the activities. And it's hard like being at home, and sometimes it's really difficult to like not eat right"
6041,Yeah yeah true.,"So besides besides that any kind of recent exposures to any fumes, dust, animals, pets like anything like that?"
6042,"Yeah, it was kind of like vacuuming a couple of days ago when it got really bad, but nothing. Not not. I don't think there's not been any other exposures.","OK. And do you have any past medical conditions that you have been diagnosed with like asthma, eczema, anything like that?"
6043,"I haven't been diagnosed with anything. No. I did have like I know that I would sometimes get kind of short of breath as a child. But my mom doesn't really trust doctors, so she wouldn't take me to one.","OK, have you had shortness of breath after that, like when like as a child, how old were you?"
6044,"I must have been like 8 years old or 9 years old that I remember, but I think I've had it before that as well as my mom tells me.","Oh OK, do you have that at all now?"
6045,"No, no, I don't.","OK, OK Have you ever seen an allergist before?"
6046,"No, no.",No OK. Do you have any known allergies to any medications? Yeah any medication?
6047,no,no. Do you take any medications at all on a regular basis?
6048,No.,"No, OK. Have you been hospitalized or had any surgeries in the past?"
6049,No.,"Any family history of any asthma, eczema, allergic rhinitis. Anything like that?"
6050,"Yeah, I think it kind of runs in my family like everyone in my family is just kind of always having this runny nose and sneezing. My mom has it. My younger brother has it. But like we haven't really been diagnosed with anything like we, we rarely go to the doctor.","OK, OK, and currently right now, do you work at all? Or sorry, do you go to school?"
6051,I do I do. I've been doing it virtually.,"Virtually OK, so have you noticed anyone sick around you?"
6052,No.,No OK. And what at home? What's your living situation like? Who do you live with?
6053,"I live with my mom, dad and my younger brother.","And, yeah, I just want to let you know that any questions I ask you today and anything we talked about it's completely confidential and unless like there is any potential harm to yourself or anyone anyone else. So yeah, I'm just gonna ask you a few questions. Do you feel safe at home?"
6054,Oh yeah.,"OK, and do you drink alcohol at all? Or have you tried alcohol?"
6055,"No, not at all.",Have you tried any recreational drugs like marijuana?
6056,No. No.,How about smoking?

6058,No.,"No OK. And so overall, do you feel safe in your home and as well as outside of your home environment? Any kind of bullying or anything like that going on?"
6059,"No, not at all.","OK, alright. Yeah, so those are kind of all the questions that I had for you. Sorry just one more question, any loss of sense of taste or smell?"
6060,"Yeah, it's hard to smell and my nose is stuffy, but no loss of taste.","Yeah, OK. OK, so do you have any questions at all for me?"
6061,"No, I just I I just wanna get some medications to help with this. I'm just sick and tired of my runny nose.","Yeah, it must be very frustrating. So you've tried Reactin before, right?"
6062,yeah,"Yeah, so one method is to definitely like stay away from some of those allergens that are potentially causing your symptoms. But I I do really think so you might have something called like allergic rhinitis. And I think it might be beneficial to for you to see like an allergist"
6063,sure.,"And so I can refer you to someone as well. Just have a sense of what kind of things allergic to you and like what medications you would require. In the meantime, definitely like any antihistamine medications would help with your symptoms. But since you're also having congestion and sneezing, just just in case, we will just do a COVID swab test for you today. And it takes around 24 to 48 hours to come back. And in the meantime, you should just isolate as much as you can in your own home. And then based on the result they would give you more instruction."
6064,Sure,"Alright. Thank you, take care."
6065,"Hi so I brought my 6 year old son in today because yesterday during soccer practice, he he developed this pretty severe cough and he couldn't catch his breath.","OK, so this happened yesterday, you mentioned?"
6066,"Yeah, it happened yesterday afternoon.","OK, uhm so you mentioned a cough. Is it a harsh barky cough, or is it more like a muffled cough?"

6071,"No, that that's gotten a bit better, that resolved about an hour. Like after he stopped playing but he was, he was short of breath yesterday.","OK, and have you tried anything for his cough, for his shortness of breath or wheezing?"
6072,"No, we haven't",No OK. Does he have a fever at all?
6073,"No, he doesn't mention anything about feeling hot or or or having chills either.","No OK, and any rashes that you've noticed?"
6074,No,"No, weight loss over the past few weeks?"
6075,"No, he's been gaining weight well.","OK good, has he had a stuffy nose or runny nose?"
6076,"Well, sometimes he will get a runny nose. He takes like Reactin or Claritin or some sort of allergy pill for that sometimes, but that's usually like the changing of seasons that will happen more often.",OK OK. Does he have any allergies?
6077,"Yeah, to mostly environmental triggers. I'm not sure if the specific things are, but I just know it gets worse. Maybe in the spring, springtime?",OK. And does he have asthma?
6078,"He's never been diagnosed, but he has had uhm or his sister has asthma.","OK, OK. And has he? Have you noticed any changes in his vision or hearing?"

6087,Nothing like that.,"OK, OK, so you mentioned he has asthma. He might have asthma. He was never formally diagnosed. Does is he otherwise healthy or does he have any longstanding medical conditions?"
6088,"He's been healthy. Yeah, I know he did have like he would get some itchy skin when he was a bit when he was like a baby, but he hasn't needed any creams for that for a long time.","OK so he might have something like eczema, you think?"
6089,"Yeah, yeah I think he did.","OK, OK and is he on any medications right now?"
6090,"No, he doesn't take anything right now.","OK, Uhm during his mom's pregnancy with him, were there any complications?"
6091,"No, she was uhm healthy and he was born at term with a normal weight and able to go home relatively quickly, so there weren't any concerns.","OK, that's good and was he healthy like after birth?"
6092,"Yeah, so he's he's done well. There weren't really any concerns with development or or growth, and he's doing well in school.","OK, OK, good. How about uhm so was he a full term baby and was it a vaginal delivery?"
6093,Yes. Yes for both,"OK, any complications during the delivery?"
6094,"No,","OK, and he didn't need any hospitalizations like right after birth as an as a newborn?"
6095,No,"No, OK good. Uhm Is he up to date with all his immunizations?"

6098,"No, nothing like that.","No, OK. OK. Uhm and does anyone at home smoke?"
6099,No,"No OK. Any old carpets? Does mold, asbestos, anything like that at home?"
6100,"We we took out the carpets and stuff when his sister was diagnosed with asthma, so it's good from that perspective.","OK, good, and who lives at home with him?"
6101,"So it's myself, his mom and then his sister.","OK, OK, any pets at home?"
6102,He's got a fish.,"A fish, OK. And has he has come into contact with anyone sick recently?"
6103,"No, I don't think so. I mean when at school, they've been pretty diligent with I mean covid and everything right now, so I think he's been OK.","Ok, uhm has he traveled anywhere recently?"
6104,No.,"No, OK. OK, those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own for me?"
6105,"Yeah, I was just wondering if if my son had asthma as well and if like you need a prescription for inhalers.","Yeah, so we're gonna since he's never been diagnosed before, we're gonna do some investigations for him just to start so we can do, we can start by doing a pulmonary function test for him to see what his lung activity is like uhm so we'll start there and then we'll also, because you're saying he's short of breath, we'll take his oxygen saturation as well, and maybe even do some like some basic blood work for him, and if it turns out he has asthma, which in this case I do strongly suspect, we'll prescribe him some bronchodilators like a short acting beta agonist as well as an inhaled corticosteroid because his symptoms do seem somewhat severe this time around. And then I should also mention because some of his symptoms overlap with that of COVID, he will also get a covid swab and you should hear back about that in 24 to 48 hours. How does that sound?"
6106,"That sounds good, thank you.","Alright great, thank you."
6107,"I just bringing my son in today because he's had this cough that's been going on for a few days now and for these past two days, I've noticed that he's been just tugging at his ear more as well.","OK, so you said the runny nose started two days ago?"
6108,"Yeah, yeah he had a cough yeah cough and runny nose started about yeah 2-3 days ago","Okay, the runny nose, what color is the discharge?"
6109,Pretty clear and watery,"OK, and the coughing is it dry, or is it bringing up any phlegm?"
6110,It's been dry.,It's been dry OK. And does it sound harsh?
6111,"Not really,",No?
6112,I don't know. It sounds kinda like a typical cough.,"OK, has he lost his sense of taste or smell?"
6113,He's been a bit more irritable and not eating as much but I'm not sure.,"OK, how about changes in his vision or hearing?"
6114,No,OK. Any fevers?
6115,"Uhm, I don't think so. But he, we haven't checked and he's been, yeah, as I said, kinda, a little bit irritable.","OK, any weight loss recently?"

6118,"No,",No rashes OK. And how about shortness of breath or wheezing?
6119,"No, I haven't heard that.","No, OK. And then have you actually taken a look into his ears?"
6120,"No, I haven't. He has just been tugging at the right one.",Is he itching it at all?
6121,"Uh yeah, I guess just kind of like really rubbing it around the outside and pulling on the lobe a little bit.","OK, any discharge? Oh sorry go ahead"
6122,Sorry I'm just gonna say yeah he's been kind of fussy and pointing at it and no discharge from the ear.,"No discharge, OK. Does it look swollen?"

6129,"No, I don't think so.","No OK, is he an otherwise healthy child?"
6130,"Yeah, he he is. I mean he, uhm about six months ago he had uhm croup I think but he recovered quickly from that and he didn't need to be hospitalized or anything.","OK, and his mother's pregnancy with him, was it complicated in any way?"
6131,"She had gestational diabetes, but it was diet controlled and she's healthy now from that perspective.","OK, OK, that's good. Uhm and then was he born at term?"
6132,He was yeah he was born over like 38 weeks I think,"Oh OK, good and was it a C-section or a vaginal delivery?"
6133,Uhh vaginal.,"OK, any complications during the delivery?"
6134,Uhh no.,"No, OK, how about uhm after birth? Was he hospitalized for any reason?"
6135,"No, he wasn't. He was able to go home.","OK, that's good. Uhm and has he been developing normally in terms of his motor movements, like behavior wise, social wise, like is he on par with his peers in terms of milestones?"
6136,"Yeah he is. Yeah, everything's been normal that way and he's been growing well too.","OK, good. growing while gaining weight well, OK, is he on any medications?"
6137,"No, he's not.",OK. Is he up to date with all his immunizations?
6138,"He is, yeah, we've been following along with with that.","OK, does he have any allergies?"
6139,I don't think so.,"No, Ok. Any family history of lung or heart conditions?"
6140,"Uh, no.",No OK. Does anyone at home smoke?
6141,"Uhm I do but not like in the house or anything like that, usually just well, it will always be either outside or when I'm at work.","OK OK, any old carpet, dust, mold, asbestos, anything like that in your home?"
6142,No.,No. OK. Who does he live with?
6143,"So yeah, he lives with me. It's just me and my wife.",OK. Any pets at home?
6144,We have a a dog.,OK. Has he been in contact with anyone sick recently?
6145,Uh. Not that I can think of.,OK is he in like daycare?
6146,"No, no my wife's been, been looking looking after him at home. She's the primary caregiver, well while I'm at work.","OK, any trouble recently?"
6147,No no.,"No, OK. Well, those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?"
6148,"Uhh no, just was wondering what what might be going on?","Yeah, for sure, so right now it sounds like a viral picture. It sounds like he has a cold and possibly an ear infection. I'd have to take a look into his ear to be able to tell more uhm because some of his symptoms overlap with those of covid we'll probably do a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Uhm and so after I take a look into his ears, we can do one of a couple of things, so if his tympanic membrane looks like it's been perforated, or if there's pus in there, then we'll prescribe him a 10 day course of antibiotics, and if I see like middle ear effusion or his tympanic membranes bulging, and he seems really sick like he has a high fever, what she does, I will again prescribe him 10 days of antibiotics. And if he has a middle ear effusion or a bulging tympanic membrane, just one of those two, and he doesn't seem to be too sick, we can reassess him in 24 to 48 hours. Uhm An antibiotic that we usually prescribe is amoxicillin. Uhh how does that sound?"
6149,That sounds really good. Thank you.,"OK, no worries. Take care."
6150,"Yeah, I've had uh, a cough that's been um, bugging me for the last several months now, and more recently I've noticed that I've started to bring up a bit more, or a little bit of blood as well.","Okay, well that's not good. So you said the cough started several months ago, how many months ago do you think, like three, four, five?"
6151,"Uh, yeah I would say, yeah, maybe like, like five or six, and it kind of started um, it was really infrequent and so it didn't really, well I thought it was just the usual smoking, but it's been getting worse over these last, over these past six months.","Okay and um, the blood in the cough, when did that start?"
6152,"So that started about, uh, about two weeks ago.","Two weeks ago, okay. Um, how much blood are you coughing up like, if uh, like is it the size of your palm, is it more than that, less than that?"
6153,"Uh, I would say less than that, like each time there's maybe to about the size of I don't know, uh, like a looney. So like inside of the palm.","Okay, sure. Um, and are you experiencing any shortness of breath along with your cough?"
6154,"Yeah, now that you mention it, I have been. It's uh, you know, I thought that was just kind of me getting older and the smoking, but I've certainly been able, I haven't been able to walk as far and even uh, to the end of the driveway getting the mail now is, is pretty, I'll get short of breath. Before I used to be able to walk a lot further than that, just a couple of years ago.","Yeah, for sure. Um, and sorry you said, you mentioned, you mentioned you had some wheezing as well, right?"
6155,"Um, I haven't really had any, noticed any wheezing.","No, okay. Um, and have you had a fever recently?"
6156,No.,Weight loss?
6157,"Um yeah, now that you mention it, maybe, maybe a little bit, like 5 to 10 pounds over the last, the last month.","Last month, okay. Um, any chills, fever, sorry, chills, or night sweats?"
6158,"No um, no, I haven't had anything like that.","Okay, any rashes?"
6159,No.,Changes in your vision or hearing?
6160,No.,"Um, how about a stuffy or runny nose?"
6161,"No, I haven't had any symptoms like that.","Okay um, and then change in your smell or taste?"
6162,"No, that's been normal.","Okay, and how about chest pain?"
6163,"No, I haven't had any chest pain.","Okay. Um, and do you ever feel like your heart's racing?"
6164,"No, I haven't had anything like that.","Okay, how about calf pain when you walk, like more than a block or two?"
6165,"No, I haven't had any symptoms like that.","Okay, any changes to your bowel movements?"
6166,No things have been normal there.,"Okay, any nausea or vomiting?"
6167,No.,"Uh, changes to your urine?"
6168,No.,"No. Uh, headaches?"
6169,"Every once in a while, I'll get a headache, but it's, they're pretty mild. Usually I'll take an Advil and they go away.","Sure, um, how about dizziness or fainting spells?"
6170,"No, I haven't had anything like that.","Okay, um, any confusion or memory loss?"
6171,"Uh, I guess I um, forget things a little more easily now, but, that's just part of getting older.","Okay, sure. Um, and then other questions I have for you, are um, are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any major medical, medical conditions?"
6172,"Uh, I have arthritis um, in my knees and uh, hands, um so I have a lot of pain from that sometimes, and I also have high blood pressure and um, GERD.",Okay.
6173,"Or acid reflux, yeah.",Sure. Do you take any medications for these things?
6174,"Um, yeah, I'll take Tylenol um, for the arthritis, and sometimes use some like, topical creams for my knees. Um and uh I, I take amlodipine as well, I think, for the blood pressure.","Okay. Okay, and um, are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
6175,"Yeah, yeah, I remember getting one not too long ago, actually. Well, seven years ago I guess now, but I didn't realize, that we uh, had to get anymore.","Um, so yeah, after you turn 65, they should've given you the Shingrix for shingles and pneumococcal vaccine, does that sound familiar?"
6176,"Yeah it does. Yeah, I just didn't know about them until that time.","Okay yeah, sure. Any allergies that you have?"
6177,"Uh, I don't think so.",No. How about family history of lung or heart conditions?
6178,"My uh, grandfather had, had lung cancer. And he was in his uh, 70s when he, when he passed away, I remember.","Okay, okay. And do you currently smoke?"
6179,"I do, yes. Yeah, I, I smoke um, I don't know, maybe half a pack a day now, which is, it's a lot less than I used to. I was smoking two packs a day at one point.","Okay, well congratulations on cutting down. Um, yeah, if you need help cutting that down even more, let us know, we have resources that you may be able to use."
6180,"Yeah, absolutely. Thank you.","Yeah, no problem. Do you do any other recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin, anything like that?"
6181,"Yeah since I, oh CBD drops, I, at night I find that helps with uh, sleep and, and the pain in my knees.","Oh okay, are those prescribed drops?"
6182,"Um. well I do buy, I get them from uh, like the uh, the OCS store, I think they're called.","Okay yeah. Okay, that's good that you're getting them from, like an official store."
6183,"Yeah they're for, they were, uh, my friend said that they worked for her, and so I just gave them a try and I, I found that they've helped.","Okay, good. Um, and where do you live right now? And who do you live with?"
6184,"Yeah, so I live in uh, in an apartment with my, with my husband.","Okay, And any like, old carpets, dust, mold, or asbestos in this apartment?"
6185,"No, I don't believe so. It's relatively new. We just moved out of our house, uh, just to make it a little easier on us.","Okay yeah, for sure. Um, have you been in contact with anyone sick recently?"
6186,"No, I don't think so. I've been spending a lot of time at at home uh, with my husband, and he's been okay.","Okay, good. How about travel?"
6187,"No, we've been pretty scared with uh, COVID and all that, so we've been staying, staying home for the most part.","Okay, okay, good. Um, those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own for me?"
6188,"No, I was just really concerned when I started to see um, the blood coming up more recently, and so I was just hoping to get this figured out.","Yeah, for sure. Um, so they're a couple of things we're gonna work you up for. Um, because some of your symptoms overlap with COVID, we'll start by getting a COVID swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Um, we will also do a chest x-ray um, to look for any signs of lung cancer. Um, and then if we see consolidation or anything that would indicate um, like a mass in your lungs, we will discuss options for like biopsies which is the gold standard for diagnosing lung cancers. Also, I know you haven't had any recent travel or anything like that and your symptoms have been going on for a long time, but uh, it may also be worthwhile to uh, also check for things like TB, which could also cause you to cough up blood. Um, so we'll start, we'll start from there, and then if those come back negative, then we'll work you up further for other things that you may have, but are like more rare. How does that sound?"
6189,That sounds like a good plan. Thank you.,"Okay, great. No problem."
6190,"Hi there, I, I've had this cough that started um, three days ago, and over these past couple of days, I've just been really achy all over and so, I've had a headache as well.","Okay, well I'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling well. Um, the cough, when did that start?"
6191,"Yeah, so that, about three or four days ago um, it started to come on, yeah.","Okay, and then how about the headache?"
6192,That's been more in the last two days.,"Two days, okay, and then the uh, muscle ache?"
6193,"Yeah, it's been there for about two, yeah about two or three days. I wake up in the morning and I've been feeling like really fatigued and achy.","Um, the cough, is it dry or you're bringing up phlegm?"
6194,"It's, it's dry, but it's gotten a little bit worse since it started. It's just been happening more often.","Okay, and does it sound harsh?"
6195,"Uh, maybe a little bit, yeah.",Okay. Is it getting worse do you think?
6196,"Yeah, I think so.","Okay, are you experiencing any shortness of breath along with the cough?"
6197,"Uh, a little bit after, um, if I have like a coughing fit that's bad enough, but um, for the most part, I've been okay.","Okay, any wheeziness?"
6198,"Um, no.",No. Chest pain?
6199,No.,Okay. Do you ever feel like your heart's racing?
6200,"No, I haven't felt like that.","Okay. Um, any dizziness or fainting spells?"
6201,No.,"Uh, numbness or tingling?"
6202,No.,Uh confusion or memory loss?
6203,No.,"This headache, is it always there?"
6204,"These past couple of days, yeah, it's kind of, it, it's been there. It's been a little bit more mild after using some Tylenol or Advil to help settle it down, but I just have this, yeah, achiness in the front, front of my forehead and kind of sides of my head.","Yeah um, sides of your head, okay. And 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt, how, how would you rate it?"
6205,A 4.,"A 4 okay, so it's not the worst headache you've ever had in your life?"
6206,"No, it's not that bad, it's just been pretty annoying.","Yeah um, okay. And have you like, do you usually get headaches?"
6207,"Not really it, yeah I don't get them that often. I guess they come when I, I, well, get sick.","Okay yeah, that makes sense. Um, have you had any fevers recently?"
6208,"Um, I have felt a bit hot um, and, but I, I didn't check my temperature and um, yeah.","Okay. How about weight loss, have you experienced any weight loss recently?"
6209,"No, I've been, my weight's been pretty stable.","Okay. Um, any rashes?"
6210,"No, I haven't noticed any rashes.","Okay, um, and any changes in your hearing or vision?"
6211,No.,Runny nose or stuffy nose?
6212,No.,Sore throat?
6213,"Um, yeah, now that you mention it, I have had a little bit of a sore throat as well. Hasn't been too painful with um, like swallowing uh, foods or anything like that. It's kind of worse in the morning and it's not so bad later on.","Okay um, alright. How about changes in your smell or taste?"
6214,"No, nothing like that.","Um, changes in your bowel movements?"
6215,"No, I've been uh, regular.","Okay um, and then nausea or vomiting?"
6216,"Nope, I haven't had anything like that.","Okay um, changes in your urine?"
6217,"No, I've had UTIs, like one or two in the past, um, so I know what that's like. So yeah, everything's been normal.","Okay, good. And are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions?"
6218,"Uh, I have asthma, which I will like, asthma and allergies, and I'll use um, just Ventolin for that every like once in awhile, but it hasn't bugged me too frequently.","Okay. Um, do you also take anything else for that asthma or is it just the Ventolin that use?"
6219,Yeah just Ventolin.,Okay. Have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?
6220,"No, well I, I've had my, my wisdom teeth taken out and, actually yeah I had my tonsils out as well when I was 12.","Okay. Um, are you on any medications besides Ventolin?"
6221,"Yeah I, I currently, I think a birth control.","Okay, how long have you been on that for?"
6222,"Uh, since high school, so I, yeah since I was 18 so eight years.","Okay, and um, are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
6223,"I am, yeah. I get the flu shot every year.","Okay, okay, good. Any allergies?"
6224,"Uh yeah, to cats and um, like, I think environmental triggers. No medicines.","No medicines, okay. Any family history of lung or heart diseases?"
6225,"Um, my grandfather had, had a stroke when he was in his 70s and um, but he was like, a smoker and a drinker, and didn't really look after himself very well unfortunately, and uh, but that's about it.","Okay, um and do you smoke?"
6226,"No, I don't","No, okay. Any other recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin or anything like that?"
6227,"No, I don't use anything like that.","Okay. How about um, alcohol, do you drink?"
6228,"Yeah, sometimes, I'll have a or maybe a cocktail on the weekend, or um, a glass of wine with dinners.",Okay. Are you currently sexually active?
6229,"I am, yeah with uh, with my boyfriend. Um, we use uh, condoms as well.","Okay, so you use both condoms and you're on birth control so, okay good, that's a lot of protection. Um, how long have you two been together?"
6230,"Um, uh six months.","Okay, okay, good. And um, any sick contacts recently?"
6231,"Um, not that I'm aware of.","No, okay. Any travel recently?"
6232,"Nope, just been um, going to, or just been doing online uh, classes. I'm finishing up my masters right now.","Okay, okay wow, congrats."
6233,Thank you.,"Um, and where do you live and who do you live with?"
6234,"Yeah, so I live in an apartment downtown here um, just with uh one of, one of my friends who's a roommate.","Okay, and is everyone at home healthy?"
6235,"Yeah, she hasn't had any any symptoms, any symptoms either.","Okay. Okay, well those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions um, or anything that you wanted to bring up that I haven't covered?"
6236,"No, that's it. I was just uh, I mean concerned about COVID. I've been hearing about this new variant and stuff on the news so, a little bit worried.","Yeah for sure. We will definitely um, take a swab from you today and we'll see um, what the results are. You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but in the meantime you should self isolate for 14 days um, and if it's not COVID, if that comes back negative, and um yeah, some of your symptoms also sound like other typical viral symptoms, so you could have one of the common strains that's going around this time of year. So for that just, it's um, you should just um, do some supportive care, you know, staying hydrated, eating well. And if your symptoms become worse, uh, you're running a really high fever, you have any neurological symptoms like weakness or seizures, then you should seek help from the ER. How does that sound?"
6237,That sounds good. Thank you.,"Okay great, thank you."
6238,"Yeah hi, um, I have been coughing nonstop for the past three days, and today I have been feeling very short of breath. So I just wanted to get it all checked out.","Yeah, for sure. And, so you said the cough started uh, three days ago. Were there any triggers to the cough or anything that, uh that changed three days ago?"
6239,"No, nothing that I can think of um, I have, like the only thing that I've been doing is going to the grocery stores, uh the bank, and laundromat. Um, and once I ran all these errands, like, I just started having this coughing fit that hasn't stopped.","Okay, uh, has the cough gotten any better, or stayed the same, or gotten worse these past three days?"
6240,"Uh, it seems like it's getting worse.","Okay, are you bringing up any uh, sputum or phlegm?"
6241,"Um yes, it's yellow.","Okay, is this um, any different from before? Like have you had a cough in the past and, and brought up phlegm, or is this entirely new for you?"
6242,"Um no, this has happened to me before, um, like I don't know, like maybe a year or two years back. Uh, and it kind of feels the same, but just a little bit worse.","Okay. Um, and uh, have you seen any blood in the sputum?"
6243,"No, no blood.","Okay. Um, and you mentioned you've been short of breath as well. Uh, how has that come on?"
6244,"Um, it was, I, I don't know if it's because of all the coughing that I've been doing, but it just started this morning.","Okay, um, and have you been experiencing uh shortness of breath um, on exertion otherwise, like prior to this?"
6245,"Um no, no.","Okay. And have you had any shortness of breath after, like if you lie down flat?"
6246,"Um, no, not that I've noticed","All right, and have you had a wheeze?"
6247,"A little bit, yeah.","Okay um, uh, and have you had any um, infectious-like symptoms such as like red eyes, runny nose, or, or a sore throat?"
6248,"No, nothing like that.","Okay, um, have you had any, any chest pain?"
6249,"Nope, nothing like that.","Have you had any lightheadedness or, or feeling dizzy?"
6250,No.,"Or feeling like your heart's racing or, or beating really fast?"
6251,No.,"Okay. And, um, have you had any fevers or chills?"
6252,"No, not that I've noticed.",Have you had any night sweats?
6253,No.,And how has your weight been over the last several months? Have you had any weight loss or gain?
6254,"Uh no, it's been pretty stable.","Okay. Um, and have you had any abdominal pain?"
6255,"Um, no.",Any diarrhea?
6256,No.,Or any urinary problems?
6257,No.,"Okay. Um, and in the past um, oh sorry, before that, have you had any nausea or, or vomiting?"
6258,No.,"Okay. Uh, and any confusion or, or changes to um, um memory?"
6259,No.,"Okay, uh, or loss of taste or sense of smell?"
6260,Uh no.,"Okay uh, so the, you've been experiencing this cough that's been getting worse over the last couple of days, as well as bringing up some yellow sputum, um, and been short of breath. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?"
6261,"No, that's pretty much it.","Okay. Um, and in the past, have you um, been diagnosed with any medical conditions?"
6262,"Um, I have diabetes, I have high blood pressure and I have high cholesterol.","I see. Alright, and do you take uh, medications for those things?"
6263,"Yes, so I am on ramipril for the high blood pressure, rosuvastatin for the cholesterol, and insulin for the diabetes.","Okay, thank you. And uh, you mentioned you had a similar episode in the past. Um, what, uh, were you diagnosed with COPD before?"
6264,"I was, I was diagnosed with COPD about five years back.","Okay, did you have pulmonary function tests for this? The test where you had to breathe into a tube."
6265,"Um yeah, I had that done like five years ago.","Okay, um, alright um, just wanted to see if it was uh like formally diagnosed. Sometimes people uh, um, yeah, it's important to have that, uh, those tests done. Um, and do you have any allergies?"
6266,"Um, no none. None, yeah.","Okay. Um, and uh, are your immunizations up to date?"
6267,"Yes, I believe so.","Okay, um and have you had any surgeries or, or um, hospitalizations?"
6268,"Um, I had my Gallbladder removed when I was in my 50s. Um, and I had a hip fracture three years ago.","Okay, and how is your mobility now?"
6269,"Um pretty good. My hips still give me some issues once in awhile, but um, for the most part, it's been okay.","Okay, that's good. It sounds like the rehab went well."
6270,Yeah.,"And uh, right now, can you tell me um, a little bit about your living situation? Like where you're living and who you're living with?"
6271,"Um, I live by myself in an apartment on the 1st floor.","Okay, um and, do you smoke cigarettes?"
6272,"Uh no, I quit two years ago.","Okay, and that's, that's great. Um, prior to that, how long did you smoke for, and how much?"
6273,"Oh, for like 40-plus years um, I used to smoke a pack a day.","Okay, well that's great that uh, that you quit, so congratulations."
6274,Thank you.,And do you drink alcohol?
6275,"I drink once in a while. Like maybe every other day, I'll have a glass of wine.","Okay, and um, uh anybody, or sorry, have you been around anybody who's been sick recently?"
6276,Uh no.,You said you went to the stores and stuff like that.
6277,"Yeah, maybe from there, yeah.","Okay, and have you traveled anywhere else, outside of the city?"
6278,"Um, not recently, no.","Alright, um, and any exposures to any like dust, chemicals, things like that?"
6279,"Um, I live in an old building so maybe. Um, but it hasn't bugged me before.","Okay, uh, and are you working currently or, or retired?"
6280,I'm retired.,"Okay, well, what did you do before?"
6281,"I used to work uh, on the assembly line for Chrysler.","Okay, were there any exposures uh, there that you were aware of, like things that you were breathing in?"
6282,"Uh not that I was aware of, but they were always like smoke and fumes and things like that because it was like a factory, so maybe.","Right, okay, that makes sense. Um, and in the family, are there, anybody who, who's had problems with their hearts or lungs?"
6283,"Um, my mom had lung cancer when she was 50. And, like, all the, like diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol runs on my, ran on my father's side of the family.","I see, did anybody have uh, heart attacks or, or stroke?"
6284,"Uh, yeah, so my father had a heart attack when he was 49. Uh, stroke I'm not too sure about.","Okay, thank you. And, um, so that was all I wanted to ask about. Um, was there anything else that you wanted to add that I maybe forgot?"
6285,"Um, no, that's about it, but I, how can I treat myself now? How do I make this cough go away?","For sure, so, um, we will first get your vitals here and we'll see if your oxygen levels um, are low, then it would be important to put on some oxygen first, um, just to make sure that that's stable. Um, and from there we will um, get a chest x-ray um, and uh, run some lab work to, to try to help figure out the, the diagnosis better, but in the meantime, we'll use um, some inhalers because it's possible that this is a COPD exacerbation similar to uh last year, um, and the inhalers should help open up the airways and dilate, so make breathing easier, and then um, also if it is a COPD exacerbation, it will likely require antibiotics, as well as some steroids for the, the inflammation for five days. Uh, but since your symptoms currently overlap with uh, COVID as well, you'll have to get a, a COVID nasal swab."
6286,"Okay, okay for sure.","Okay, so uh, we'll get that started."
6287,"Hi, um, I'm here because I, I had this cough for a couple days and now my voice still hasn't recovered. It sounds really hoarse and I can't speak as well, so I was just wondering if you can give me something for that.","Possibly we will see just gotta ask a few questions first, and we'll, we'll do a physical exam as well afterwards, but certainly, we'll look into what is causing your symptoms. So you mentioned a cough. When did that exactly start?"
6288,That started three days ago.,"Okay, and have you had a cough before?"
6289,"Um, like before the three days you mean?",Yeah.
6290,"Um, no, I was pretty healthy before then.","I see and uh, with the cough, are you producing any phlegm or sputum?"
6291,"No, it's pretty dry.","Okay, have you noticed any blood?"
6292,No.,"Alright, and have you had a wheeze?"
6293,"No, uh, no, nothing like that.","Alright, and have you had any uh, chest pain with the cough?"
6294,No.,"Alright uh, and you noticed that your voice is, voice changed, and that was about 3 days ago as well?"
6295,"Yeah, that, so, well no, actually that started about yesterday. Yeah, yesterday in the afternoon.","Okay, and uh, any triggers for this? Like were you at any events that you had to be uh, kind of speaking loudly or talking a lot or anything where you're straining your voice?"
6296,"Um no, no, I wasn't. I was like, I had school, I came home, I didn't do anything like that.","Okay. Yeah, so it sounds, yeah, just sort of came on on its own. Alright, and have you had any like, eye redness, or discharge, or a runny nose?"
6297,"I have had uh, I've had a runny nose before, but no eye discharge.","Okay. With the runny nose, what, what, what could you describe the uh, mucus that was coming out?"
6298,"Uh, it was, it was clear.",And has that gone away now and then when was the runny nose?
6299,"Yeah, that's gone, yeah that's gone. That went away but like, um, yeah, two days ago maybe.","I see, and have you had a sore throat or do you have a sore throat?"
6300,"Um I have, so, it hurts because I'm coughing, but it doesn't seem like it's my actual throat.","Alright, is there any pain with swallowing food or liquids?"
6301,No.,"Okay. Um, and have you had any fevers or chills?"
6302,No.,"Or any, any night sweats?"
6303,No.,And any changes to your weight recently?
6304,"Um, I've had some weight gain over the past like six months.","Okay, well that's great. And about how much?"
6305,"Uh just, maybe like 5, 10 pounds. 5 to 10 pounds, somewhere around there.","Okay, well that's good. And um, have you had any nausea or vomiting?"
6306,No.,How about any abdominal pain?
6307,Uh no.,"Any uh, diarrhea?"
6308,No.,Or any urinary problems?
6309,No.,"Have you had any muscle aches or, or joint pains?"
6310,"Uh, no.","Okay, and have you had any loss of your taste or sense of smell?"
6311,No.,"Okay, um, and any skin changes or rashes?"
6312,"Nope, nothing like that.","Okay, uh, and um, so you've been experiencing, so you had a runny nose that's gone away um, and now you've been having this cough for the past, dry cough, past three days and lost your voice yesterday. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?"
6313,"Um no, no other symptoms.","Alright, in the past, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?"
6314,"Uh no, I've been pretty healthy.","That's great, and u, have you been, um, have you had any allergies before?"
6315,No.,"Okay, and uh, do you take any medications regularly?"
6316,"Uh, I just take some multivitamins.","Okay, and uh are you aware if your immunizations are up to date?"
6317,"Uh, so I have everything except for that HPV vaccine.","Okay, um, is it, do you have a plan to get that one or?"
6318,"I think so. I'm just uh, waiting to follow up with my family doctor about that.","Okay, well that, that's a good idea for sure. So it's great that you have a plan for that, um, for that. Yeah, it can be really helpful for preventing cervical cancer, as, as I'm sure you'll talk to the, with the family doctor about. Yeah, and have you had any hospitalizations or any surgeries?"
6319,Uh no.,"Okay, um, where about are you living right now, and who are living with?"
6320,"I live uh, with my parents um, and my two younger siblings. We live in a house.",Has anybody else been sick or have similar symptoms?
6321,"Uh no, no one at home's been sick.","Okay, and uh, how about anybody at school or, or work, or anything like that that you've been around who's been sick?"
6322,"So one of my friends actually had like a runny nose and a cough as well a couple of days ago, but uh, she seems to be better now and her voice is okay.","Okay, and um, have you traveled anywhere outside of the city or province?"
6323,"No, no, not recently.","Alright, and, um, in the home, is there any uh like, are you exposed to any violence of any sort, like physical or emotional, either yourself or, or witnessing?"
6324,No.,"Okay, and what grade are you in?"
6325,"I'm in grade 7 or, yeah grade 7 now.","Oh awesome, and uh, I don't, is there any smoking in the home?"
6326,"Uh no, no one smokes at home.","Okay um, and then, um, anybody in the family uh, have any heart or lung conditions?"
6327,"Heart or lung? I know, um, like, heart disease, runs on my father's side of the family. I'm not really sure like exactly what, what kind of diseases though.","Okay, um, and I, sometimes people that, kind of in this age group, might experience with either drugs or alcohol. Have any of your friends done that or, or yourself?"
6328,"I know like some of my friends have uh, tried alcohol and try marijuana, but I haven't experimented yet.","Okay, that's good and um, I, that's all I wanted to ask today on history. Was there anything else that you wanted to add?"
6329,"Oh, nothing that I want to add. I just, what do you, how do you think I can make this, make my voice better? And how long will I have, have this horse voice?","Yeah, so uh, right now it's sounding like um, a viral type illness where there's inflammation of the vocal cords, uh, with having the cough and the runny nose a couple of days ago. Actually, this reminds me that. Have you, I'm not sure if I asked about fevers or chills, if you have any?"
6330,"Uh no, I haven't.","Okay, um, and so for, if it is a viral infection then, um, it's just supportive kind of management. So that will mean trying to stay as hydrated as you possibly can over these next um, next few days and then also you can use things like, if they help, like lozenges or something along those lines. Um, but it will, it will just take some time for it to come back on its own, a few days to a couple of weeks sometimes. And the cough could possibly last for um, two to four weeks after um, after having a viral type illness."
6331,Okay.,"Yeah, so it could be quite a few weeks that the symptoms last for. But since you're having a cough, and these symptoms could overlap with COVID we'll want to get a COVID swab today as well um, and kind of go from there."
6332,"Yeah, um I haven't been feeling very well over the past two days. I have had this cough, I'm feeling very short of breath and I'm feeling very feverish as well.","Okay, uh, have you checked your temperature?"
6333,"No, I haven't actually checked it, but I'm just feeling hot and I'm having chills.","Okay, were you having like night sweats as well?"
6334,"Um, yeah, last night I did get sweaty.","Okay, and when uh, when did you start feeling feverish?"
6335,"Feverish, maybe around the same time like right after the cough and shortness of breath started, maybe like a day and a half ago.","Okay. It's um, so the cough started about a day and a half ago as well?"
6336,Yes.,"Okay. Uh, did you have a cough prior to this or is it new?"
6337,It's new.,"Okay, is it a dry cough? Or are you bringing up sputum or phlegm?"
6338,"Um, it's uh yeah, it's um, it's dry most of the time, but once in a while I'll see some like yellow phlegm.","Okay, have you noticed any blood?"
6339,"No, no blood.","All right, and have you had any chest pain?"
6340,"No chest, well actually, when I try to take a really deep breath in, it, it hurts, my chest hurts.","Okay, where do you feel the pain?"
6341,"Uh, it seems to be central on my chest.","Do you feel it radiating anywhere, like to your back or to either side?"
6342,No.,"Okay, how would you describe the pain? Like sharp, dull?"
6343,"Um, it's pretty sharp when I take a deep breath in.","How long does the pain last for, and is there anything that you do that makes it go away?"
6344,"It was like less than a minute um, and, and it goes away when I like, if I try not to take a deep breath in.","Okay, so it sounds like that it, the, the breathing is a trigger there, when you're breathing in deeply."
6345,Yeah.,Alright. And have you had any wheeze?
6346,"Uh, a little bit, yes.","Alright, and uh, is the wheeze new as well?"
6347,"Um yes, that also started after the coughing and the shortness of breath.","Alright. And have you had any episodes of feeling like your heart's racing, or is it speeding really fast?"
6348,No.,"Okay, and you said it, yeah, you've been short of breath as well. Um, are you really short of breath now, and what sorts of things have been really bringing it on for you?"
6349,"Um it's, yeah, I'm still a little bit short of breath and I, I guess the shortness of breath gets worse when I'm walking or doing something physical.","Okay and did, is this new or did you have this before?"
6350,It's new.,"Okay, have you noticed any swelling in your in your legs or extremities?"
6351,"No, nothing like that.",And do you get short of breath if you lie down flat?
6352,"Uh, no, not that I've noticed.",And how many pillows do you sleep with?
6353,"Uh, just the one.","Okay um, and have you had any headaches?"
6354,No.,And how about any eye redness or discharge?
6355,Uh no.,Have you had a runny nose or felt congested?
6356,"Um, yeah a little bit. Yeah, I've been, yeah, I've been feeling a little congested.",And when did that start?
6357,"Um, that started a little bit before the cough, actually.","Okay, and you're still feeling that now?"
6358,Yeah.,Okay. Have you had a sore throat?
6359,No sore throat.,"Okay, and um, have you had any um, muscle aches or body pains?"
6360,"Um I, yeah, I guess my muscle aches a little bit um, it's very dull though, it's not sharp.","Okay, and uh, how has your energy been? Have you been fatigued?"
6361,"Yeah, my energy's been pretty low. Um, I've been feeling very tired.","Okay, and how long has that been going on for?"
6362,"Um, for about the same amount of time. Like three days, yeah.","Alright, and have you had any abdominal pain?"
6363,No.,How about nausea or vomiting?
6364,No.,"And any changes to your urinary habits, like pain or?"
6365,"Uh no, nothing like that.","Okay, and um, how has your appetite been?"
6366,"Um, it hasn't been the greatest because I haven't been feeling well, but I've still been eating.","Okay, have you had any weight loss over the last several months?"
6367,"Um, no, not that I've noticed.","And uh, how about any changes to your sense of smell or sense of taste?"
6368,"Sense of smell or taste, no, no changes there.","Okay, um and then any skin changes or rashes?"
6369,No.,"Alright, um, so you've been experiencing this cough, uh, started a couple of days ago with um, shortness of breath, and you're bringing up sputum sometimes and, and a fever that's started a bit more recently, as well as having some night sweats."
6370,Yeah.,Have you experienced any other symptoms?
6371,"Uh, no. Other than that, no symptoms.","I see, and have you tried anything to make, make the symptoms better?"
6372,"Um, I've tried some Tylenol, I've tried some, um like, cough suppressants, but nothing seems to be helping.","Okay, um, and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?"
6373,"Um, no, not um, well actually, I have, I had, I have osteoporosis, for which I'm taking calcium and vitamin D, as well as like um, alendronate, alendronate, some sort of bisphosphonate.","Okay, have you had any, uh, like bone fractures?"
6374,"Um, I had um, a hip fracture, like uh, two years ago.","Okay and um, and how is the recovery and mobility been?"
6375,"Um, pretty good now.","Oh, that's great. And uh, do you have any other medical conditions besides osteoporosis?"
6376,"No, not that I know.","And have you had any surgeries prior, um, aside from the hip surgery two years ago?"
6377,"Um, I had my wisdom teeth taken out, I've had my gallbladder taken out, um, and I, I had like um, I had a PE um, a long time ago.","Okay, and what happened around that time, with the pulmonary embolism? Did you, was there a trigger, like a surgery around that time? Or were you immobilized or anything?"
6378,"Yeah, they think it happened right after my um, gallbladder removal 'cause I was in the hospital for a while.","Okay, and so were you on any medication for a period of time after that?"
6379,"Uh, yeah, I was, but not anymore.","Okay, um, okay. And um, are you taking any other medications besides the ones for your bones?"
6380,"Um, no, no other medications.",And do you have any allergies?
6381,"Uh, no.","Okay, uh, and then could you tell me a little bit about your living situation right now? Are you living with anybody and uh, whereabouts?"
6382,"Um, I live in an apartment by myself and um, it's in London.","Okay, great, and do you have any supports in the home that, that help you with uh, any activities of daily living, like um, either dressing or bathing or making food or even doing some of the shopping?"
6383,"So I am pretty independent for most things. Um, there will be like a CCAC care worker who comes in, uh, once in a while just to help me clean the house.","Okay, so once in a while, is this like once a week or once, yeah, how often?"
6384,"Yeah, once every two weeks.","Okay, well that's great. It sounds like you're managing really well on your own. Um, do you have any other supports nearby, like family or, or friends?"
6385,"Um, I have some family close by um, my son lives close by, uh, and my daughter lives about 2 hours away. I'll see them about once a month.","Okay. Um, and do you smoke cigarettes?"
6386,"Um, yeah, I used to smoke, but I stopped about five years back.","Oh, congratulations on quitting."
6387,Thank you.,"So you quit five years ago, and how long did you smoke for and how much did you smoke?"
6388,"Um, I used to smoke, not a lot, just like one or two a day, uh, and I did that for about 25 years.","Okay, and uh, do you drink alcohol?"
6389,"Um, I'll have like a glass of wine once in a while.","And how often is once in a while? Is this, or how many drinks per week would you say?"
6390,"Um, per week, maybe like three.","Okay, um, and any uh, heart or lung conditions that run in the family?"
6391,"Um, yeah so, there is um, like lung cancer, there's asthma, there's uh, COPD. All of that, someone, like my, both sides of my family had.","Okay, and uh, anybody in the family have like a bleeding disorder?"
6392,"A bleeding disorder, no.","Okay, anybody else in the family have either a deep vein thrombosis or, or PE?"
6393,No.,"Alright, um, and have you been around any, anybody who's been sick?"
6394,"No, not recently.","Alright, and have you traveled anywhere outside of the city, or?"
6395,"Uh, no.","Okay, um, so that was everything I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything that uh, that you wanted to add?"
6396,"No, those are all questions that I had. Um, do you think um, I need to be hospitalized, um, because I'm very short of breath, or do you think I can just um, stay at home? Do you think I need antibiotics?","Yeah, so we'll, we'll check your temperature and, and confirm the fever and um, check your oxygen levels as well. You might need oxygen, um, you're mentioning, with your shortness of breath. Um, and we will get a chest x-ray, and if um, we're seeing consolidation there, suggestive of pneumonia, you may need antibiotics that will cover, cover those, those bugs. However, your symptoms do overlap with COVID as well, and so it will be important to get a, um, COVID swab. But to answer if you will need a hospital stay, I think we'll need to at least wait until some of the investigations come back and, um, that will help determine how severe the symptoms are and we'll observe you over the next few hours, and if you are getting any worse or um, anything like that, then it might be a good idea, um, to uh, to be admitted."
6397,"Okay. Okay yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.",You're welcome.
6398,"Hi um, I'm bringing my one year old daughter in because she's had this fever um, this runny nose and this cough, for the past three, four days. Um, and now, she sounds pretty wheezy.","Okay, and um, as she had a fever the entire time over the past three or four days."
6399,"Yeah, I would say so like it's come and gone, but every time I checked her temperature, I tried to check her twice a day, it would be pretty high, like 38 or uh, 39.","Okay, so it was between 38 and 39 each time you checked it."
6400,"Yeah, and now I should mention like um, I checked today and she didn't have a fever today, but she sounds really wheezy now.","Okay, is the wheeze new today?"
6401,Uh yeah.,"Okay, um, and the cough, that started about three or four days ago as well?"
6402,"Yeah, that's right.","And how, how does the cough sound? Does it sound like, barky or like a, seal-like cough?"
6403,"Um, it sounds pretty harsh. I don't know if it sounds barky.","Okay, and is the cough worse at any particular time of the day, like morning or night?"
6404,"Uh no it's, it's just always there.","Okay, uh, is she bringing up any, any phlegm or sputum?"
6405,"Um, she's bringing up some, um, she's, she actually, she used to bring up some phlegm, but now it's, it's pretty dry.","Okay, um, so she was bringing up phlegm initially and is no longer. What colour was it?"
6406,It was clear.,"Okay, any blood that you noticed there?"
6407,"Uh, no, no blood.","Okay, um, and yeah, she's, she's had a wheeze as well. Um, have you noticed, uh, any chest pain, if she's like pointing to her chest or anything?"
6408,"No, nothing like that.","Okay, and has she had any, any like fainting spells?"
6409,No.,"Okay. Um, and, yeah so she's had a fever, has she had any like, chills or night sweats, like where she's shaking?"
6410,"Oh no, no.",And how has her mood been?
6411,"She's been pretty fussy, um, yeah, she's been pretty fussy over the past few days, but I just thought it was because of how she was feeling um, like her symptoms.","Yeah, certainly. Has she been eating and drinking okay?"
6412,"Yeah, we've managed to get her to drink and eat okay. Um, so, in that sense, no changes there.","Okay, how many diapers is she, how many wet diapers per day?"
6413,"Uh, about five.","Okay, so yeah, still been to maintain hydration, it sounds like. Um, yeah, okay, and has she had any like, eye redness or eye discharge?"
6414,"Uh no, nothing like that.","Any suggestion that she might have um, like any ear pain or, or any ear discharge?"
6415,No.,"Okay, and has she had a runny nose?"
6416,"Um yeah, now that you mention it, yeah, she did have a runny nose. Um, it seems to be less now, but she did have a lot a few days ago.","Okay, and did that start around the same time as the cough and, and fever?"
6417,Yeah.,"Okay, um, it's still going on, but, but just less."
6418,"That's right, yeah.","Okay. On feeds or anything like that, did you notice like any redness in her, in the back of her throat?"
6419,"Um, I noticed some, um, yeah, I noticed some redness, but I just thought it was because of her coughing a lot.","Okay, um, and um, have you noticed any skin changes or, or rashes?"
6420,No.,"Alright, and any changes to bowel habits like diarrhea?"
6421,"Uh no, no changes there.","Okay. Then any changes to um, like urinary habits as well?"
6422,"Uh no, no changes there.","Okay, and have you noticed any like bulging on her, on her forehead or on the anterior fontanelle?"
6423,No.,"Okay. Um, and uh, has she had any nausea or vomiting?"
6424,"No, not that I've noticed.","Alright. Um just yeah, she's been a little bit more, um, irritable as well. Um, okay, and has she had any symptoms like this before?"
6425,"I mean, when she was a few months old she had similar symptoms, um, and she was like hospitalized for maybe a day or two, but she became better.","Okay, did she need like antibiotics or inhalers or anything like that?"
6426,"I think they just gave her some oxygen and then um, some fluids.","Okay. Um, has she been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?"
6427,No.,"Okay, and besides that one time going, like going to the hospital, has she been hospitalized or had any surgeries?"
6428,"Uh no, before that she was fine.","Alright, uh, are the immunizations up to date?"
6429,"Yeah, everything's up to date.","Excellent. Um, and in terms of the pregnancy itself, were there any complications throughout um, with mom?"
6430,"Uh, no, no, no complications.","Okay. And was it a full term delivery, and vaginal or c-section?"
6431,"It was uh, full time and it was vaginal.","Okay, any concerns at birth, like jaundice or, or any types of distress?"
6432,"Uh no, nothing like that.",And how is her growth and development been thus far? Any concerns?
6433,No.,"Okay, um, that's great, and in terms of um, the home environment, who's living with her and um, who's primarily looking after her?"
6434,"Um, so it's her dad and I, as well as her um, her grandma.","Okay, and has anybody in the home been sick recently?"
6435,"No, everyone's been healthy.","Okay, um, and has there been any travel?"
6436,"Um no, we haven't gone anywhere recently.","Okay, um, and does anybody uh, in the house smoke?"
6437,"Uh, nope.","Okay, and are there, are there any pets or are there any like carpets or um, linens that can hold, hold a lot of dust or dander?"
6438,No.,"Okay, any other exposures, to like triggers, or potentially things that, that could be exposed or stuff like, that could be inhaled?"
6439,"No, I don't have anything like that at home. It's a fairly new home and uh, it's hardwood floors, yeah.","Okay. Um, and uh, any family history of lung problems or heart problems?"
6440,"No, no.","Okay, how about a family history of any congenital diseases or um, any genetic diseases?"
6441,"No, nothing like that.","Okay, um, and family history of any cancer?"
6442,No.,"Okay. Um, so were there any other um, so that was everything that I wanted to ask today before I went on to the physical exam. Um, was there anything else that you, that you wanted to add or were wondering about that I maybe forgot to ask?"
6443,"Yeah um, what, what can we do for her um, to make her better? And are you concerned about her breathing?","Um, so the, the physical exam and the, the vital signs will really, will help with um, to assess her breathing and to see oxygen levels."
6444,Yeah.,"Um, and um, this could be uh, caused by um, a viral infection, which could be something along the lines of uh, like a common cold type picture, and we can get like inflammation of uh, really small airways, um, and it can cause that cough, and fever, and some of the symptoms that she's experiencing. And also, um, these symptoms do overlap with COVID as well, um, and so it'll be important to get a COVID swab just in case. Um, but um, if that is the, the scenario, then it will be um, supportive care with oxygen, fluids and we'll make sure that um, that her, her breathing is uh, okay. And possibly, we'll need steroids and um, and uh, an inhaler if necessary."
6445,"I just started having, um, difficulty with breathing um, starting yesterday. And I also developed this cough um, yesterday morning.","Okay, so did, did the cough come first or the breathing, difficulty breathing?"
6446,Kind of around the same time when I woke up in the morning.,And did it wake you up from sleep at all? Like did you wake up trying to catch a breath or anything?
6447,No.,"Okay, so it happened after you had woken up and gotten out of bed. And um, so, can you describe your cough a little bit? Is it wet or is it dry?"
6448,"Um, it's just um, it's just a dry cough.","Okay, you're not bringing up any sputum or any other material?"
6449,No.,"And uh, are you coughing up any blood by any chance?"
6450,No.,"For the shortness of breath, can you describe it a little bit? Is it, are you having trouble taking deep breaths, or are you breathing faster? Can you describe it?"
6451,"Yeah, I just feel like um, I'm getting out of breath really easily, just like um, walking even, walking to the kitchen from my bedroom, I'm getting short of breath and it, it just started yesterday morning, it's so odd.","Okay, and have you had anything like this happen before to you?"
6452,No.,"No. Were you doing anything before it started? Like were you doing any, any activities or any, are were you doing any exertions at all?"
6453,"No, I was just uh, I, I slept in, I slept in a bit more than usual, um, and I was feeling quite um, drowsy. My, my doc increased my pain meds and I took the first dose um, yesterday night, um, I actually took an extra pill um, um, of the morphine um, and yeah, I don't know, maybe it, it's an allergic reaction to the morphine.",Have you had any allergic reactions before?
6454,No.,"And so you took an extra morphine last night and then went to sleep. Um, did you wake up coughing or catching your breath or anything like that?"
6455,"No, I actually, I ended up waking up at 1:00 PM or 2:00 PM, I was just very drowsy and uh, I think I, I think I might have taken a bit too much, I don't know. The, the arthritis pain was just killing me last night and I thought taking an extra pill would help.","And is this, are your symptoms constant? Or do they come and go?"
6456,"They're constant for the past two days. I've also noticed that I have, my breath just smells really bad. I don't know why.",Is that something you noticed recently or in the last two days?
6457,"Yeah, since yesterday. Actually, not even yesterday, this morning I would say.","This morning, okay. Um, and is there anything that makes your symptoms worse? Like does lying down make your symptoms worse?"
6458,Not really.,"No. How about exerting yourself, does it make your symptoms worse?"
6459,Yeah.,"Okay. Um, do you have any other symptoms like any fevers or chills?"
6460,"I checked my fever last night, it was um, 37.2.","Okay, so you didn't have a fever last night, okay. Um, do you have any other symptoms like dizziness uh, any fainting spells?"
6461,No.,"Okay. How about sore throat, headaches, muscle pain, anything like that?"
6462,No.,"Okay, any chest pain?"
6463,"No, I don't.","And um, have you been traveling at all recently?"
6464,No.,Any contact with anyone who has been sick recently?
6465,No.,"No. Uh, any nausea or vomiting?"
6466,No.,Okay. Any night sweats?
6467,No.,"Okay, any swelling in your legs or arms, hands?"
6468,"No. No, I haven't noticed any of that.",Any fatigue? Just feeling more tired today?
6469,Maybe a little bit.,"Okay. Have you been having any cold-like symptoms before the two days, like in the last week, like runny nose, sore throat?"
6470,"No. I was, like, I was absolutely fine.","Okay. Um, how about, do you have any changes in your bowel movements like constipation, diarrhea?"
6471,No.,No. Any trouble with urinating?
6472,No.,"Okay, any sleep or appetite issues?"
6473,No.,"Okay. Have you lost uh, significant weight in the last few months?"
6474,No.,"Okay. Um, have you been exposed to anyone who may have had tuberculosis?"
6475,I don't think so.,"No, and uh, do you have any pets or animals at home?"
6476,"Um, I have a dog.",Have you ever had any allergies to any pets or animals?
6477,No.,"Any exposure to fumes or dust uh, with where you live?"
6478,No.,"Okay, and do you have any past medical history? Any diagnoses?"
6479,"I um, I just have the osteoarthritis.","Osteoarthritis, okay. Is that why you're taking the?"
6480,"Yeah, yeah.",And are you taking any other medications?
6481,"I take uh, Advil.","Advil, okay. Any allergies that you know of?"
6482,"Um, no.","Okay, any previous hospitalizations?"
6483,"Um, I had my wisdom teeth removed. But no, I wasn't, I wasn't hospitalized.","Okay, is that the only surgery that you've had, or have you had anything else?"
6484,"Yeah. No, that's it.",Any family history of any lung or heart conditions?
6485,Uh no.,Any cancers?
6486,"Um, breast cancer, my grandma had it.","Um, any uh, and currently, what's your living situation like, do you live with someone?"
6487,"Um, I live with my husband.",Okay.
6488,And my dog.,"And your dog, okay. And did your husband tell you anything, like that has changed in your behaviour at all uh, recently?"
6489,"He just said that I was, I was just extremely drowsy yesterday and I was very hard to wake up.","Okay. Okay, um, do you smoke currently?"
6490,No.,Have you smoked in the past?
6491,No.,"Okay, and do you work currently?"
6492,"Uh I, I do.","And uh, how would you, sorry, dis you say you don't work or do you work?"
6493,"I'm a banker, but I'm working virtually, uh, remotely right now.","Okay. And um, do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana?"
6494,"I um, no. Well sometimes I'll use marijuana for the pain, but I haven't been doing that recently, for the past two months.","Okay. Um, how, how often would you say you use it?"
6495,"Only when the pain gets uh, too bad, so maybe um, three or four times a month.","Okay, and do you use any alcohol?"
6496,"Um, yeah, I'll, uh, I'll drink once a week, two glasses, two or three glasses of wine.","Um, any, alright, so I think that those are all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns for me?"
6497,"Um, no.","Okay, so yeah, definitely with the coughing and shortness of breath we will definitely get a COVID swab test done. Um, that should come back in the next 24 to 48 hours and then public health will contact you. Um, yeah, based on what you're telling me so far, we will definitely do a physical examination, get your vitals, and get your oxygenation and everything done. But I also think, since you were very drowsy and were, had fallen asleep and were really difficult to wake up, sometimes you can get what's called aspiration pneumonia. Um, and that's, that can also be a possibility and what we will do is get a chest x-ray, get some blood work done as well today. Um, now we may require antibiotics, and if your vitals unstable we might actually admit you as well. Um, does that sound good?"
6498,Yeah.,"Alright, so yeah, we'll get those tests done and we'll be there with you shortly. We'll also get like an EKG done as well."
6499,Sure.,"Alright, okay."
6500,"I am here with uh, with my daughter, who has just been having a cough for the past um, two weeks.","Okay, um, and can you describe the cough a little bit? Is it a dry cough or is she bringing anything up?"
6501,"Um, it is a, it is a dry cough, um, but she just keeps coughing and coughing and, and then she just, you know, once she'll start coughing she just doesn't stop. And then um, there's been times when she just turns blue, she's coughing so much. Um, and then it just gets, gets better um, on its own. But yeah, it's a dry cough.","Okay, and um, what does the cough sound like? Is it like a harsh cough, a barky cough?"
6502,"Um, it's just, she just makes this noise when she's like breathe, trying to take a breath in. It's, it's yeah.","Okay, is it kind of a wheeze?"
6503,"Yeah, sure.","Okay. Um, and so there's episodes where she also turns blue?"
6504,"When she's coughing a lot, yeah, she does.",Okay.
6505,She's also vomited once or twice.,"Oh, I see, okay. Um, any blood in the vomit? Or is she coughing up any blood?"
6506,No.,"No, okay. Um, any, so this started two weeks ago, any kind of symptoms of runny nose or um, cold-like symptoms before then?"
6507,"Yeah, yeah she did have a bit of a runny nose. It was just uh, watery, uh, since discharge. And at that time her cough, she had a cough as well. Um, but I thought it was, you know, it's nothing. It was just like another flu and it would get better, but then she just, the runny nose got better without, in a couple of days, but the cough stayed. And it got, got pretty worse, uh, it got worse.","Okay, um, other than the cough uh, any, any fevers or chills?"
6508,"No, I don't think she's had fevers. I haven't checked, though.","Okay. And the cough is pretty constant, or is it, does it come and go?"
6509,"Yeah, she just has these episodes where she just coughs and coughs and coughs, and then she'll either vomit or just turn blue, or just um, get better in a couple, couple minutes. This kind of comes and goes like that.",Okay. And is there anything that has helped her at all? Like any over the counter medications or anything like that?
6510,"I haven't tried anything, I'm just worried about, you know she's my first child and I don't know what to give her and what not to give her at this age. So I just decided to come in and not try anything over the counter.","Okay. Um, and so, has this happened before at all?"
6511,No.,"No, this is the first time, okay. Um, any so, she, she is vomiting. Um, is the vomit like green in colour? Or is she just vomiting up what she has eaten? What's the content of the moment?"
6512,It's usually just what she's eaten.,"Okay, um, any sick contacts recently or any travel?"
6513,"No, I don't think so. Not, nothing really.","Um, and how about her behaviour? Does she seem like uh, very tired or fatigued, or more irritable?"
6514,"She does get tired, especially after, and then she's irritable and crying after, you know, she has these fits of coughs.",Okay.
6515,Yeah.,"Okay. Um, any symptoms of diarrhea or constipation?"
6516,No.,"Okay. Any um, any trouble with urinating at all?"
6517,No.,No. How's her sleeping like?
6518,"Uh, not great. It's just the cough keeps uh, waking her up and she just doesn't, can't fall asleep.","Okay, any uh, exposure to dust or fumes, or animals or pets at home?"
6519,"We, we did get a cat um, about a month ago.","Okay. Um, and any, has she been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?"
6520,No.,"Um, and any allergies that you know of?"
6521,"Um, no.","And um, any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?"
6522,No.,"And how was your pregnancy, your pregnancy with her, like any complications at all?"
6523,"No, no complications. It was uh, it was very, yeah, it went well.",And was she at term or premature?
6524,"She was at term, she was born at term.","Was it a vaginal delivery or uh, a c-section?"
6525,"Uh, vaginal.","And did she have to stay in the NICU at all, at the hospital afterwards?"
6526,No.,"Okay. And is she feeding well, like what does she usually eat?"
6527,"She's feeding well. She's doing uh, she eats everything, yeah.","Um, and any family history of any medical conditions?"
6528,No.,"Um, and does anyone smoke in the house?"
6529,"Um, her dad, but he, he doesn't smoke in front of her.","And what's her living situation like? Who does she live with? And do you live in a house, apartment?"
6530,"Oh yeah, we live in an apartment. It's uh, me, my partner, her and the cat.",Okay. And any difficulties or complications with her growth? Like in terms of her weight or her height?
6531,"No, no complications. She's doing okay.","Okay. And in terms of her milestones, has she been meeting all of them on time?"
6532,Yes.,"Okay. Alright, so I think those are all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns?"
6533,"Uh, no.","Yeah, so based on the symptoms, oh yeah, sorry I forgot to ask one other question. Has she, are her immunizations all up to date?"
6534,"Oh no, no. I don't, I don't get those. My friend's, my friend's daughter developed autism and I'm just, I don't want that, you know, so no. I don't vaccinate my kids. Or I don't vaccinate my daughter and I haven't been. Yeah, uh no, I won't be doing that.",And have you been vaccinated throughout your life?
6535,"Um, maybe when I was young, but I, yeah I don't, I just don't believe in vaccinations. I, yeah, no, I don't, I don't get those.","Yeah, so there is definitely uh, there's a lot of research done beside, behind vaccinations and a lot of prevention goes into them, but definitely there is some anecdotal evidence of very loose associations to autism that have been found to be invalid and like they have been invalidated by the research. So definitely, it's very important to get your child vaccinated. In fact, the sum of the symptoms that your child may be having right now can be caused by something called pertussis, and um, there's usually a vaccination for that. Like after pregnancy as well, so that's something that is definitely on the differential, and at this time we definitely need to make sure she's okay and get her vitals done, see her oxygenation saturation, and just do supportive care while she's in the hospital, and we may need to admit her, but we'll do the full physical examination today, get a COVID swab done as well. And usually it, she's currently in the, it seems to be the second phase, where she's vomiting and coughing a lot, and then it usually, after that phase, two or three more weeks of just coughing. And so, we're going to do some supportive care for her right now, but yeah, definitely, you should consider vaccinating your child. We recommend that to every parent as there's a lot of diseases out there that can be completely prevented if you vaccinate your child."
6536,"Okay, I'll think about it.","Alright, so, so for now we're gonna just make sure that she's doing well, okay?"
6537,Sure.,"Alright, take care."
6538,"Um, I've just had difficulties with breathing for the past, I want to say eight, nine months. And um, my wife just told me to come in. It's just, she was worried about it and uh, I thought I'd just come in and have it checked out.","Okay, so it's been going on for the last eight to nine months. Has it been getting worse at all?"
6539,"Yeah, I would think so. I would say so, yeah. So,","Sorry, go on."
6540,"So, it was just um, I feel like I just get short of breath more easily now.","Okay, and is it short of breath with activities? Or are you getting short of breath with uh, sitting or resting as well?"
6541,"So when I'm, when I'm, with activity.","With activity, okay. And the cough that you're getting, is it a wet cough or a dry cough?"
6542,It's a dry cough.,"Okay. And are you bringing up any material at all, like any um, yellow or green sputum?"
6543,"No, no.",Any blood?
6544,"Um, no, no blood.","No blood, okay. And with your shortness of breath, is it, are you having difficulty taking deep breaths, or do you find that you're taking more fast, shallow breaths?"
6545,"Um, just, I guess, just uh, shallow breaths.","Okay, okay. And um, so this is over the last eight or nine months. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all, like chest pain, dizziness or fainting? No?"
6546,No.,"Okay. And do your symptoms get, get worse at all when you're lying flat, like when you're sleeping?"
6547,No.,No. And do you ever wake up gasping for air?
6548,No.,"Okay. Um, and have you tried anything that's helped you uh, relieve some of these symptoms?"
6549,"Sorry, could you say that again?","Uh, have you tried anything like over the counter, to help you relieve these symptoms?"
6550,"No, no I haven't.","Um, have you traveled at all recently?"
6551,No.,Have you been in contact with anyone that's been sick?
6552,"Um, no, not really. I, I did go out to the pharmacy to get my medications, but that's, that's the only time I actually interact with anyone outside of my home.","And what, what medications do you take?"
6553,"Um, I just take aspirin.","Aspirin, okay. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?"
6554,I had a heart attack.,"Oh okay, well when was that?"
6555,Last year.,"Last year, well I'm so sorry and um, did they give you any medications to go on after that?"
6556,"Yeah yeah, yeah there, there were a couple of other medications as well. Something um, something, something -pril. And uh, I think there's uh, uh, rosuvastatin.","Okay, and do you still take those?"
6557,"Yeah, I take those. Sometimes I forget that I do, I try to take them as much as I can.","Okay, and you also take the aspirin. Alright, have you noticed any fevers or chills?"
6558,No.,Nausea or vomiting?
6559,Nope.,And any chest pain?
6560,"Uh, no.","No, okay. Any increased fatigue?"
6561,No.,Any diarrhea or constipation?
6562,No.,Any numbness or tingling anywhere?
6563,No.,"Any confusion or memory, like memory loss?"
6564,"Um, no, I don't think so.",Any trouble urinating?
6565,"Um, no.","Okay, have you noticed any swelling um, in your feet, ankles, legs at all?"
6566,No.,"Okay. Um, and how's your appetite been like?"
6567,"Um, it's been, it's been the same.","Okay, and any um, significant weight changes? Have you lost any weight?"
6568,No.,"No. Um, any exposure to fumes or dust within your environment?"
6569,"Um, not right now. When I was young, yeah.","Okay, now did you, so did you have exposure to fumes or dust?"
6570,"Um, I used to work in a mine so.",A mine?
6571,"Yeah, lots of chemicals and things like that.",Okay. And any exposure to any pets or animals?
6572,"Uh, no.","Besides your medical history of having a heart attack and some blood pressure, um, any other medical conditions?"
6573,"Uh, I just have high blood pressure.","Okay, any allergies to any medications or any environmental allergies?"
6574,No.,"Okay. Um, any hospitalizations besides when you had a heart attack, previously?"
6575,No.,Any surgeries?
6576,No.,Okay. Did they tell you at all what the cause of your heart attack was?
6577,"Um, they just uh, they said it was my, my diet.","They said diet, okay."
6578,"Yeah, something about cholesterol.","Did you require any stents, or did you have to get a bypass surgery or anything like that?"
6579,"Uh, they put in, I think they put in stents.","Stents, okay. Um, any family history of any heart or lung conditions?"
6580,"Yeah, um, my um, mom had heart failure.","Okay, um, and how old was she when she had her heart failure?"
6581,"She was young, she was uh, 55.","55, okay. Um, and currently, right now, or sorry, do you have any family history of any cancers, any lung cancer or anything like that?"
6582,No.,And currently do you work or are you retired?
6583,I'm retired.,Okay. And what's your living situation like right now? Do you live with anyone?
6584,I live with my wife.,"Okay, and do you smoke?"
6585,"Uh, no.",Have you ever smoked?
6586,I did when I was young.,How long would you say you smoked for?
6587,"Um, I'd say 45 years.",And how much would you smoke in an average day?
6588,"Um, about a pack a day.","Um, any recreational drugs like marijuana?"
6589,No.,And do you drink alcohol?
6590,"Yeah I do. Um I'll, I'll drink a glass at night, every night.","And a glass of, what would you drink?"
6591,"Oh just a, a glass of wine, white wine.","Okay, so those are all the questions I have for you today. Any questions for me?"
6592,No.,"Okay, so yeah, there's definitely like the coughing and shortness of breath are definitely concerning, and they've been going on for a pretty long time. Do you ever have any night sweats or anything like that?"
6593,No.,"Okay. So there's a few things that we think about with the chronic shortness of breath and a cough. One could be just a COPD diagnosis with your long history of smoking. And this pulmonary function test, get an x-ray, chest x-ray as well. Um another thing that we need to look out for is uh, lung cancer. And since you have been smoking for a pretty long time, even though you may have quit, which is really great, but that long history of smoking, especially also with um, you working in a mine, those are some things that means we can test as well, and so we may require like a chest x-ray, and even um, a CT scan of your lungs as well. Um, so yeah, first we'll just do a couple tests, do a physical examination, get your vitals, do some blood work and do some of those tests and then we'll also get a COVID swab test done for you as well, just in case. Does that sound good?"
6594,Yeah.,"Alright, so we'll be with you shortly."
6595,"Um, I'm just, I'm here because I've had this cough for the past two weeks and uh, it's just not going away.","Okay, and um, is it getting worse at all really?"
6596,"Not really, it's just been the same.",How would you describe the cough? Is it a wet cough or a dry cough?
6597,It's a dry cough.,"Okay, are you bringing up any uh, sputum or blood at all?"
6598,Uh no.,"Um, would you describe it as like a, a barking cough, a harsh cough, or a muffled cough?"
6599,Not really.,"No, okay. Um, before you started uh, coughing, did you have any other symptoms, like runny nose, congestion, sore throat, anything like that?"
6600,"Uh, no.","Okay, so it's just the cough?"
6601,Yeah.,Okay. Any fevers or chills?
6602,Nope.,"Okay, and is the cough constant, or does it come and go?"
6603,"It, uh, I guess it's just, it's there throughout the day.","It's there throughout the day, okay. And is it brought on by any activities or, or does it just come on by itself?"
6604,It comes on by itself.,"Okay, and has it gotten any better at all or stayed around the same?"
6605,It's stayed the same.,"Okay. Has this happened to you before, where you had a cough for a long time?"
6606,No.,"No, okay. Um, do you have any other symptoms like chest pain, sore throat?"
6607,No.,"Okay. Um, any recent travel or contact with anyone that's been sick?"
6608,"I don't think so, no. I just went to my, I went to see my family doctor um, for some prescriptions.",Okay.
6609,"Um, three weeks ago.","Three weeks ago, okay. Any headaches at all?"
6610,No.,"Okay, nausea or vomiting?"
6611,No.,Any night sweats?
6612,"Um, no, nothing like that.",Any fatigue at all?
6613,No.,No. Any shortness of breath?
6614,No.,And no chest pain?
6615,No.,Any diarrhea or constipation?
6616,No.,"Okay. Um, any wheezing at all?"
6617,No.,"Okay, any changes in your weight recently?"
6618,"Um, no, no, I don't think so.","Any changes, sorry, any issues with your urination?"
6619,No.,Are you sleeping well or does the cough keep you up at night?
6620,"Um, it's, it's not so, it hasn't interrupted my sleep.","Okay, and how's your appetite been like?"
6621,"No, everything's okay.","Okay, and any uh, loss of your sense of taste or smell?"
6622,No.,"No, okay. Um, any exposure to any fumes or dust within your environment, or animals or pets?"
6623,No.,"Um, and otherwise, do you have any medical conditions like asthma, COPD, anything like that?"
6624,"Um, I went in for, I went in for a checkup three weeks ago, and uh, I found out I had high blood pressure. You know, who would have thought and then my doc started me on this pill called ramipril and uh, I've just been checking my blood pressure on a regular basis, and it's yeah, it's been good. But other than that, I'm very healthy.","Okay, and no asthma?"
6625,No asthma.,Okay. And any allergies to any medications or any environmental allergies?
6626,"Um, just penicillin.",Just penicillin. And have you taken any antibiotics or penicillin recently?
6627,No.,"No, and um, what medications are you on?"
6628,"Just, just that one.",Just the ramipril?
6629,"I also take, I also take a multivitamin.","Multivitamin, okay. Have you been hospitalized before or had any surgeries?"
6630,No.,"No, okay. Um, any family history of any lung or heart conditions?"
6631,"Um no, no, I don't think so.",Okay. Any cancers?
6632,"Yeah, uh, pancreatic cancer and colon cancer runs in the family.","Okay, and is that uh, any direct relatives, like your mom or dad or kids?"
6633,"My, my grandparents on my mom's side.","Um, and currently, do you work um, or are you retired?"
6634,I'm a lawyer.,"Okay. And, uh, do you work from home right now? Or do you go in person?"
6635,Yeah I've been working from home.,"You've been working from home, okay. Um, and what's your home situation like right now? Do you live with anyone? Do you live in a house or an apartment?"
6636,"Um, I live, I live in an apartment. I, um, I live alone I just got, I had a divorce two years ago and since then I've been, I've been living alone.","Okay, I'm sorry. Um, and is, in your home environment, is there any kind of allergens like dust or any mold or anything like that?"
6637,"No, nothing like that.","Okay, and currently do you smoke at all?"
6638,"Um, sometimes.","Sometimes, how often would you say you smoke?"
6639,"Um, maybe uh, two or three cigarettes. Maybe three or four days a week.","Okay, and how long have you been smoking for?"
6640,"Um, so I, I used to smoke a lot when I was young and then I quit. And then I started again two years ago.","Okay. Um okay, and do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana?"
6641,"No, I don't.","Okay, um, and do you drink alcohol?"
6642,Yeah.,How much would you say you drink on an average day?
6643,"More than I would like to mention. I, yeah, I, maybe 5 or 6 beers a day.","Okay, and um, is this something that's new for you, or has been going on for years now?"
6644,"Again, that started about two years ago, so.","Um, and uh, do you use, so no other recreational drugs, right?"
6645,"No, nothing else.","Yeah, so we can definitely talk more about alcohol usage definitely, especially when there's uh, people going through stressful times. There can be increasing substance use, including alcohol, so we definitely have a lot of resources that we can um, discuss today if you would like."
6646,"Yeah, I would really like that. Thank you.","You're welcome. Um yeah, but those are all the questions I had for today. We'll definitely do like a physical examination, but it seems you've just been having a cough for the last two weeks."
6647,Yeah.,"Without any other symptoms. Um, okay, so do you have any questions at all for me?"
6648,Um no.,"So what we'll do is, since you've had this cough for the last two weeks, we definitely want to do a COVID swab, just in case. You've been uh, working from home, but if there was any potential contact, they usually, it comes back in 24 to 48 hours."
6649,Okay.,"Other than that, sometimes uh, with a history of smoking, you can have something called uh, COPD. We can, like after the physical examinations and everything, we can potentially discuss doing pulmonary function tests as well. Um, and yeah, but other than that, it can also just be like a dry cough, can be just a viral upper respiratory tract infection that takes two or more weeks to resolve. In that case we wouldn't really."
6650,Sure.,"Um, yeah, so we'll do the physical examination and then go from there."
6651,Sounds great.,"Alright, take care."
6652,"Hi, I just came in uh, I just had this sudden, just this morning after I woke up, this sudden shortness of breath and like each time I take a deep breath I'm getting this chest pain.","Okay, and this just started this morning, you said?"
6653,Yeah.,Were you absolutely fine last night?
6654,"Yeah, I didn't have any trouble last night.","I see, I see, okay. Um, any other, does the chest pain only occur when you're taking a deep breath in?"
6655,"Yeah, mainly it's during that time.","Okay, um, have you had any other symptoms such as a headache or cough, or runny nose, congestion, sore throat?"
6656,"Um, no. No, nothing like that.",And changes in your bowel movement? Any pain in your belly?
6657,No.,Any urinary symptoms?
6658,No.,"Any um, any pain in your legs?"
6659,"Um, I did notice last, last night and for the last few days that my right calf like, just feels um, painful and it seems a bit more swollen.","Um, was there anything that you were doing a couple of days ago? Any, say, any flights or periods um, where you might be sitting still or lying still for awhile? Any surgeries, anything like that?"
6660,"I was, I was just discharged from the hospital um, last week after a hip surgery.","Um, okay. Were you moving around at home after the hip surgery?"
6661,"Um not, not really. Like I was, I was told I should move around a bit, but it's been quite hard.","Um, alright, and do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?"
6662,"Yes, I have uh, high blood pressure, and um, I also have this thing like, like varicose veins.","Um, do you take any medications?"
6663,"I, I take this medication called um, lisinopril.",And any new medications that were started after your hospital stay?
6664,"Um, no, they gave me like some pain medications I seem to, uh, um I got hydromorphone medication. I've been trying to stay away from it though, just taking Tylenol instead.",Is your pain controlled well with Tylenol?
6665,"Yeah, I tried to suck it up. I just don't wanna go on those other medications. I've heard like, you can get addicted to them.","Yeah, that's fair, that's a fair point. But it's also, I guess it's important that you move around at home. Um, so maybe try to, maybe we can increase your Tylenol dose, or maybe um, see if there's another pain med that you can be started on if you're not interested in opioids, just to make sure that you're moving around 'cause that's very important. At the hospital, did you receive an injection in your, in your tummy."
6666,"An injection in my tummy, um.","Every day, once a day?"
6667,"I think so, yeah I did.","Okay, okay. Um, alright. And do you have any allergies?"
6668,"Uh, no allergies.","Okay, um, and who do you live with?"
6669,"I live alone. Yeah, right now I live alone in an apartment.",Were you discharged with any support?
6670,"Yeah, I do have a nurse coming in, like every, everyday, but I don't, they, they didn't come like yesterday.","Okay, okay. Um, and do you smoke, or did you ever smoke in the past?"
6671,"I used to smoke in, probably in my 20s and 30s, but then I stopped when I had kids and stuff.",Do you drink alcohol?
6672,"Um, yeah, probably uh, a glass, once or twice um, every couple days.","Um, and sorry. just going back, how much did you smoke in your 20s and 30s and for how many years?"
6673,"Probably smoked for, probably, 15, 15 years, probably like, like half a pack a day.","Alright um, and do you consume any marijuana or any recreational drugs?"
6674,No.,"Okay, alright. Well given your symptoms, um, with the, with the swelling and the pain in the right calf and the difficulties breathing, it's very likely that you have um, and your recent hospitalization and hip injury, um it sounds like you might have something called, or pulmonary embolism, basically, which is a blood clot inside your lungs, and so we'll do a scan of your lungs to see what's going on. We'll also do an ultrasound of your leg, and then um, we might have to treat, uh, this with blood thinners. And we definitely have to hospitalize you, and we'll be measuring your vitals and seeing if you need any oxygen to help you out."
6675,"Okay, I'll be, I'll be here for a while then?","Well, we'll keep you for a bit, at least the next couple of days until your, your breathing gets better. And you've, you've been started on anti, on blood thinners."
6676,Okay.,"And we can be sure that you're, you're doing okay, we'll also continuously monitor your vital signs um, to make sure that you're doing well, and then we'll make sure that you're discharged. We will also get you some physiotherapy here while in the hospital to help you um, mobilize better when you get home. Um, and we'll also do a COVID swab just in case. Did you have any exposures to anyone in the past couple of days before you came, at home, after you came home?"
6677,"No, I've been just at home, just the nurse.","I see, I see. Okay, well, we'll do a COVID swab just in case and go from there. Do you have any questions?"
6678,"No um, yeah, that, that sounds good.","Okay, great."
6679,"Hi, so I just came in today because I've been just been feeling um, like my head's just been hurting for the past three or four days and I also felt really cold throughout the day for the last few days as well, so, um, I did end up checking my temperature just yesterday afternoon and it was um, 38.7 degrees celsius.","Okay, um. Tell me about the headache, where exactly is it?"
6680,Yeah so it's kind of just throughout like the front of my forehead and it kind of goes to the side into my temple.,And what does it feel like?
6681,"It feels like a constant aching. I've had uh, migraines before, but they like, it's not like the pulsating sensation that I usually get with them.","I see. Uh, okay, and how severe is the pain, if you had to rate it from 1 to 10?"
6682,"Um, more than like severe. It's definitely less severe than my migraines, but it, it's just constant. It's, it's just been there for the last four days and I would say probably a 6 out of 10.",Did you do anything for the pain? Did you take any medications? Anything that makes it better?
6683,"Yeah, I took a Tylenol, I took um, Advil. It helps for like a few hours and then it just comes back.",And anything that makes the pain worse?
6684,"Um, I definitely think just, if I rest, it's better if, but if I'm like, like I can't, I can't concentrate on work or like anything.","Okay. Um, and other than the, um, the fever and headaches, have you um, had any um, cough?"
6685,"No, no cough.",Runny nose or congestion?
6686,No.,Sore throat?
6687,"No, not really.",Changes in your sense of smell?
6688,"Uh, I do actually feel like I, like I am losing my smell today.",And sense of taste?
6689,"I just had breakfast today so um, breakfast was okay. I didn't, uh, but yeah, definitely sense of smell.","Okay, and any difficulties breathing?"
6690,No.,"Okay, any chest pain?"
6691,No.,"Um, do you feel like your heart is racing?"
6692,No.,Any diarrhea or constipation?
6693,No.,Nausea or vomiting?
6694,No.,Pain in your belly?
6695,No.,Any muscle aches or joint pains?
6696,"Uh, no, nothing like that.","Okay, um, do you feel like your neck is stiff?"
6697,No.,"Any numbness or tingling in your arms or fingers, or toes?"
6698,No.,"Any um, night sweats or weight loss, unintentional?"
6699,"No, I've only been gaining weight.","Okay. Any fluid in your, any sort of, swelling in your legs?"
6700,"No, nothing like that really.","Okay, um, any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?"
6701,"Yes, so I have uh, type 2 diabetes. I was just recently started on metformin medication.",When were you started on metformin?
6702,"So I think around uh, it's been around two months.","Okay, how is that going for you? Are you tolerating it okay?"

Well, given your symptoms, um, we would like to do a COVID swab, just in, or request a COVID swab to be done through public health, um, just to, just to rule it out. Your symptoms do sound like, or overlap with some of the symptoms that are seen in patients who do have COVID. It could be that you have um, just um, just I guess like your headache and fever. Um, I'll also like do a physical exam to see there's nothing else going on. But in the meantime, I, I'd like you to self isolate and stay away from the rest of your family members as well, um, at least until the results are out. And then when the results are out, if it's positive, you'll receive more guidelines from public health as to what you need to do."

6738,"No, he didn't want to go to the doctor, and it kind of just resolved, like he, it went away on its own.","Okay, alright. Um, and do you um, do you drink?"

6742,"Right now, with my mom drinking every now and then.","I see, okay. Um, alright, well that's all the questions I had, and uh, sorry one more. Have you been up to date with your immunizations so far?"
6743,"Yeah, I've been having all my immunizations. Uh, I also feel like, so with a sore throat, I also have some um, pain on the sides, like on my, on my neck. Like I almost feel like some lumps on both sides.","Oh, I see, I see. Okay, okay. Um, so I guess I, at this point I would like to maybe have it, examine you, just have a look inside your throat, maybe feel your neck for those lumps, and uh, then decide what to do from there. Um, given your symptoms, um, this could be a viral infection, or um, it could be a bacterial infection caused by um, bacteria called, or I guess, strep, strep throat. It could also be uh, mono. Um, but I'll uh, I'll have a look, we'll do the rapid strep test and uh, based on those results, we'll decide what to do. If it is strep, you might require antibiotics. If not, if it's mono and if we can do maybe a blood test for that, you might have to um, not engage in, in physical activity um, or exercise, vigorous activity, or like sports for the next couple of weeks or months as, as that can be, uh, as that can cause problems if you get hit in the, in your belly. It could cause your spleen to rupture and sometimes your spleen become very big if you do have mono, but we'll discuss all of that a little bit more after we do uh, the strep test. We'll also check your temperature, um, and see um, how you're doing. Have you been taking anything to help yourself, to help soothe your sore throat?"
6744,"Um, just some lozenges.","Yeah, so just continue uh, just drinking water and taking lozenges just to um, provide some comfort for yourself, and we'll do the test, then we can chat a bit more after."
6745,"Hi, uh, so I just came here today uh, I've been having this cough for um, the last two weeks and it just, is not going away. I've also been getting like, just a runny nose for the last couple, I would take the whole week, all of last week.","Okay, um, so can you tell me about your cough?"

6748,No.,"Okay, and the runny nose, what, what's the discharge like?"
6749,"Uh it's, it's pretty clear. It might be light, but it's not like green or yellow or anything like that.","Um, and so you've had this cough for two weeks and the runny nose just started last week. Has the cough improved over the past two weeks?"
6750,"Uh, it has, like it was much worse last week, uh, but I just can't get like, it's better now, but it's still lasting much longer than I've had a cough before.","Okay. Um, and uh, have you had a headache at all in these past two weeks?"
6751,"No, I didn't have a headache, but sometimes I feel a bit congested.","And uh, have you had any um, changes in your vision or your like uh, blurry vision, or any redness in your eyes or tearing?"
6752,"Uh no, nothing like that.","Okay, any um, changes in smell?"
6753,Nope.,"Okay, any change in uh, taste?"

6765,"Uh, no.",Unintentional weight loss?
6766,"No, my weight's been the same.","Okay. Alright, and um, so it sounds like you have a cough that started two weeks ago and then you only, and then you had two nights of, uh two nights where you felt sort of cold and you had the chills um, last week, but you uh started, you developed a runny nose um, a week ago?"
6767,"Yeah, the runny nose has been more, um, this week. It kind of like, started with a cough last week.","It, it, sorry, so it started with the cough last week?"
6768,"Um, so late last week, I would say the runny nose started.","I see, I see. Okay um, alright. I, and um, are you um, do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?"

6773,"Right now I'm uh, I usually live in a dorm going to university, but right now I'm home with my parents, uh, just doing virtual learning.","Okay, okay. Um, and have you um, is there anyone else around in the home? Or just your parents and you?"
6774,"Yeah, just my parents and me.","Alright uh, have you um, have you been around someone who might be sick, or have your parents been around someone who could be sick?"
6775,"Uh, my mom had the sniffles like last week, but she pretty much got over it.","Um, did she get tested for COVID?"
6776,"No, she, she didn't um, but it's not like, it's just more, she just thought it was a cold or something so she didn't really bother.","That's fair, okay. Um, and do you um, so I see that you go to school, um, and you mentioned you, have you traveled anywhere outside the, the province?"
6777,"No, not at all. My school is actually in Ontario, so.","Okay, great. Um, and do you currently, or have you ever smoked?"
6778,"Um, maybe like uh, a couple times just casually. I've tried it but nothing regular.",And what about marijuana?

6780,Uh no.,"Any uh, alcohol?"
6781,"Uh, yeah, just not, not much right now, but like when I, when we were at school like we would drink on the weekends.","That's good. Alright, um, so it sounds like you've had a cough for the past two weeks and you uh, have developed a runny nose last week, and your mom was ill the week before. It's possible that you just have a common cold uh, and that symptoms will get better over time. But just in case, we would also like to do a COVID swab, um, to make sure that you, just to rule out COVID. In the meantime, I would request that you isolate, self isolate at home. Stay away from your parents as well. Um, the test results should come back in 24 to 48 hours and public health will give you a call if your results are positive and we'll let you know what to do. Um, we will also do a physical exam here and check your temperature to see if you have a fever at all and um, yeah, does that sound good to you?"
6782,"Yeah, and will I need any like antibiotics for my cough?","Oh. Um, well, we, I guess, you said that you don't have a sore throat at all, right?"
6783,"No. It's just that, I just feel like the coughs been just going on, like it would be nice to just get rid of it.","Well um, I'll do a physical exam, look inside your throat, look inside your mouth, sorry, and listen to your chest, and uh, ensure that nothing else is going on, that you don't have anything like, say, strep throat or mono or you don't have uh, pneumonia, uh, bacterial pneumonia, for instance. Oftentimes um, symptoms that you have are caused by viruses and don't need to be treated with antibiotics, uh, but I'll do a physical exam, and maybe have a look at your labs as well, and then decide accordingly."
6784,"Okay, sounds good, thank you.",Okay.
6785,"Hi, yes, I just brought my son to the ER. We've noticed in the last two days he's been just making these grunting noises and just seems a little bit like just not himself, just more quiet. Not really crying.","OK, and when did you, you said last few days, when when exactly did you first notice the grunting? How long?"
6786,It was two days ago.,"OK, two days ago. Was it when, did you hear this sound when your baby is trying to breathe?"
6787,"Yeah, today I was trying to pay more attention. It seems like that like this really trying to breathe more. And also I like he's like the chest I see moving a lot more.","OK. And so you've been hearing this grunting sound, and he's been trying to breathe. And you see that his chest is moving more than usual and he's crying. Has he been sleeping well or no?"
6788,"Uh yeah, so last night it was really hard to get him to sleep. He did sleep, I would say like around like 4 hours last night, but it was really difficult.",And what about feeding? Does he take a formula or is he breastfed?
6789,"So he's, uh, he takes formula and today it like yesterday he was feeding. Today it's been really hard to get him to feed. Maybe he fed for like one or two times, but not much.",It happens when you try to feed him?
6790,"Uhm, Kind of just uh after awhile, just pushes it away, not really, uhm, yeah, uhm not really too excited about feeding.","OK, and what about diapers? How many wet diapers has he had over the past, or yesterday and today?"
6791,Probably around the same like usually has like five to six weight diapers and it's around the same.,OK. OK. Uhm and did you try anything? I know that he's six months old. Did you try feeding him anything new or anything different?
6792,"Uh, no, it's just been the bottle feeds.",Nothing new right? No solid foods yet?
6793,No.,"OK. And uh in terms of his activities, you mentioned that he's not as he's not moving and, as active as he usually is?"
6794,"Yeah, today I also thought I felt that it was a bit warm, warmer than usual, but I didn't have a thermometer at home.","OK. Uhm have you noticed, has he been drooling at all?"
6795,Drooling?,Mhmm.
6796,"No, I haven't noticed that.",OK. What about coughing?
6797,"Uhm, I haven't heard any, any coughing, no.","OK, Sorry, is he is able to sit up on his own?"
6798,"Uhm, up against like a sofa or chair, but not really on his own.",Have you ever been has been left alone over the past two days at some point? Do you feel like you might have taken something in his mouth accidentally?
6799,Uhm no I I tried checking his mouth like I was there with him like all all the time.,"No, OK nothing like that? OK, how has his immunizations been so far? Has he as he received them?"
6800,"Yeah, he's received all his immunizations, up to date.","Uhm, did he have, it has he was vaccinated anytime recently? Because sometimes you said he's warm and sometimes, sometimes just getting vaccinated can cause a reaction."
6801,"Yeah, no. He was vaccinated like I think more than two or three weeks ago.","OK, alright. And you said no diarrhea or anything like that, right?"
6802,No.,"OK, any, is he does he have any nausea or not nausea but is he vomiting? Is he bringing anything up?"
6803,"No, not really. Like he was just pushing away the bottle. But like he didn't bring anything up.",OK. Has he been limp and lethargic?
6804,"Uhm no, I don't think so.","OK, has you said that he hasn't had his formula much? But what about drinking? Like has he had anything to drink? Any milk or anything like that, or no?"
6805,"No, I don't think so.","No, she hasn't had much to eat and or drink over the past or today?"
6806,Yeah mostly.,So he might be a little bit dehydrated.
6807,Yeah.,"OK. Uhm, OK, well uhm, I, I, OK, so that's all I wanted to do know in terms of his current status, I would obviously want to examine him very carefully and see what's going on. Uhm, how has uh, how is he like just going back, how was your pregnancy?"
6808,"Pregnancy was uh, OK, no complications, but he was premature by two weeks, so I think he was born at 35 and four days.","OK, and were there any complications at that time, including complications related to the lung, something like respiratory distress syndrome?"
6809,"Yeah, so when he was born there was they needed to do, I forgot what it was, but they told me that initially he wasn't breathing, but then right afterwards after like within 5 minutes, he was fine.","Hmm, uhm, OK, uhm, was he kept in the hospital in the NICU after being born?"
6810,"Yeah, just because of that scare, they kept him for three more days, but like he was growing while there were no more episodes of the breathing issue, so they let him go after.","OK. Uhm, has, how has he been since then over the past six months?"
6811,"Since then, he's been fine. No, we didn't have to go to the hospital or anything, and during our routine visits he's been growing well, no normal issues.",Any issues because development?
6812,"No, he's been pretty, like he's been meeting his milestones according to like the family doctor.","Has he had any surgeries or any, or no hospitalizations you said, and no, uhm no diagnosis, right? He hasn't been diagnosed with any condition?"

6814,"No, not that I know.","OK, is there uh, can you tell me about his family history? Anything that you might have or uhm his dad or anyone else in the family?"
6815,"Uh, no, him, his dad and I are pretty healthy, yeah. No medical conditions.",Anything like cystic fibrosis in the family?
6816,"No, not that I know of.","OK. Alright, well we'll examine the child and look at his vitals, listen to his lungs, look, look inside his mouth and that's this sounds serious, so we'll keep you, we'll keep you updated and we'll let you know what needs to be done. He might need, potentially need antibiotics. He might need potentially, to be intubated, but we will have all these discussions after the baby's been seen and we'll draw some labs and go from there."
6817,"OK, sounds good.",Alright.
6818,"Yeah, I've had a sore throat that's been really bugging me the past four days and I've had a cough as well.","Mhmm. Uhm, when did the cough start?"
6819,"Yeah, so the the the cough started last week actually, and then and then I I got this sore throat afterwards.","Mhmm. OK, and is it a dry cough or wet cough?"

6855,Yeah.,"Alright. Any medical conditions that run in your family, anything related to the lungs, or otherwise?"
6856,"Uh, no.","OK, uhm, alright, well those are all the questions I had for you. So it sounds like last week you had itchy eyes runny nose, you were sneezing and you had a dry cough. And then over time some of those symptoms resolved and you continued to have a cough that was also getting better, but you then developed a sore throat. And you have been feeling feverish over the past two days. Did you measure, did you check your temperature last week?"
6857,"I didn't check it last week, but I checked it yesterday and it was 38.2, I think.",OK.
6858,"But yeah, but but those are the symptoms that that I've been having.","Uhm, so it sounds like you your symptoms have evolved quite a bit over the past two weeks. It could have, it could be potentially that you had a viral infection initially and might you might have like a superimposed bacterial infection, but we don't know that for sure. Uhm, we, we'll do a physical exam. Have a listen to your chest, have a look inside your mouth, look at your throat. Uhm, we, uhm, I guess the original symptoms you had last week., uhm, were seem a little bit different. It could be pharyngitis, maybe what you have right now could potentially be pharyngitis with a sore throat and the fever that you've developed over the past three or four days. So, I'll definitely have a look inside your throat as well, and if necessary we could do a rapid strep test. Uhm, and we would also have to do a Covid test just in case, and I would recommend that you quarantine at home. The results should come out in the next 12 to 20 for 24 to 48 hours. Just self isolate, stay away from other family members and then you'll find out the results. If it's positive, someone will call you from public health and then let you know what to do."
6859,"OK, yeah, that sounds good.",Alright.
6860,Thank you.,"Yeah, you're welcome."
6861,"Uh, yesterday, right after leaving work I started to not feel well and this morning I woke up with fever, ah, this like bad headache and just feeling really really sore all over.","I'm sorry that's doesn't sound good. So all this started yesterday or I guess yesterday was just with you were, not feeling too good and then just noticed all these symptoms this morning. Did you measure your temperature?"
6862,"Yeah, I checked it this morning and it was 38.5.","And uh, did you, can you tell me about your headache?"

It seems that she gets them on exertion and um they're worsened by exertion. Um at this age, one thing that definitely we want to check is if she has asthma. Um she does have some other symptoms that um are associated with asthma, like it seems that she gets um, some irritation through environmental factors as well. So what we'll do uh for her is get something called a pulmonary function test for her to see, that'll test if she in fact has asthma or not, and then based on that we will uh see if she needs any puffers. Um that can help relieve some of her symptoms. Uh and lastly, since she's having a cough, we'll also do a like a Covid test just in case as well."

7400,"Yeah, most of the times I would say we're pretty strict, strict with that. Uhm, sometimes when we're in our office I take off my mask, but usually when we're seeing other people or within close proximity, we keep the masks on.","OK. And, uh, do you, I, I guess, who do you live with at home?"
7401,I just live with my wife.,Do you think she might have had any exposures?
7402,"No, she's been fine and she doesn't have any symptoms. And she's, she's a school teacher. Right now that she is working from Canada.","OK, and do you, smoke at all? Or have you smoked in the past?"
7403,"Oh yeah, I do, or I used to smoke in my 20s and 30s, but I quit smoking.",How much did you smoke back then?
7404,Probably half a pack a day.,And for how many years?

7412,"Uhm so I think, uh, diabetes, and for my family, but I I I don't have it so and I think that's pretty much about it on my dad's side. On my mom's side and there was someone, like my aunt did have ovarian cancer.","OK, and have you, I guess have you, I forgot to ask earlier, have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations?"
7413,"Uhm I had a surgery to remove my appendix in my 20s and since then, no. No surgeries or hospitalizations.","OK.  Alright, and I guess that's all the questions I have for you. You haven't had any difficulties breathing right?"

7415,"Uhm appetites pretty OK, like I feel like, I've been more hungry, with the carry I feel like I, need to eat more.","Uhm, It's also important with the diarrhea to drink lots of fluids and to make sure that you're not losing important minerals and you're not losing like sodium or potassium in diarrhea and other things like calcium that could create problems. So, continue to eat well and continue to drink lots of water. I guess so what we'll do is we'll do a COVID swab just to just to check if you have COVID or not. We'll also do a few labs to see how your electrolytes are, do your vitals to see if you have fever, measure your heart rate and do a physical exam and then go from there. And I'll off - I'll talk to my attending as well and we'll come back and discuss the management plan with you."
7416,"Hi, so yeah, so I just came in here today at I've been having just this congestion around my nose and face like it's just something that just started an around 5 days ago.

Have you, can you tell me about your headaches?"
7417,"Yeah, so there, I started getting these headaches just two days ago, but like it's more than a headache, it's kind of mainly over the cheeks and then it goes and just above the nose",I see.

7421,"Yeah, I probably had like, it's usually in the morning I sometimes get a runny nose.",And what what comes out of your nose? What do you see?
7422,"Uhm, over the last week it's kind of like almost like a yellowish discharge.",Have you had any difficulties breathing?
7423,"Uhm no, I I don't, no.",Like that OK. Have you uhm had any chest pain?
7424,No.,OK. Uhm any other any other symptoms that you've experienced over the past five days?
7425,"I also like I. I do also feel like a fullness and pressure going into my ears as well. And then I'm not sure, but yesterday I was feeling a little warm throughout the day. I didn't get a temperature but I don't know if I had a fever or not.",Have you had any I guess like weight loss or any night sweats?

7429,"Uhm, my my daughter actually had a sore throat, just a, her last week, and she went to see a doctor.","Uhm, do you know if she had a COVID test done?"

7433,"Uh, no, no allergies.","Any medical conditions that run in the family, including any heart conditions or lung conditions or cancers?"
7434,"Uhm, yeah, so hard conditions, both my dad and uncle have had heart attacks in their 50s. But yeah, that's that's it. That's all, that's all that I know and we also have cancer on my mothers side. My uncle from my mothers side had bladder cancer.","OK. OK. Uhm, and do you you mentioned that you have a daughter. Do you, who do you currently live with?"
7435,I live with my two daughters and my wife.,"OK, and what do you do for, do you work?"

7437,"Yeah, I I, I do smoke but I've cut down significantly in the past few years. I currently only smoke, uh, probably two or three cigarettes a day. I was, I was smoking like almost a pack a day a few years back.","Oh, that's great. It's great that you're trying to cut down. Do you intend on getting the getting down the smoking even further?"
7438,"Yeah, that's that's the plan. If I can do that, hopefully by the end of this year, that would be great.",That's wonderful. Do you smoke marijuana at all?
7439,No.,"Uh, do you smoke any recreational drugs?"
7440,No.,Any alcohol?
7441,"Alcohol, just, uh, probably just on the weekends or have a couple of beers.","OK alright, uhm. So, I guess from the symptoms that you've described, it sounds like you likely have a condition called acute rhinosinusitis where you have inflammation of the sinuses in your face and potentially some inflammation in your nose as well, and often it's caused by a virus and it usually gets better in a couple of weeks. And the best thing to do is just conservative management. Try to rest and, if, if you know taking any medications, over the counter medications is helping you feel better, if you feel like Tylenol, sort of reducing some of that pressure or if doing a, taking a steam bath is sort of helping relieve that pressure, try those. Drink a lot of water to try to sort of lear out all that mucus that's that's building up. I'll also do a physical exam and talk to my attending and confirm all this information with him and we can go from there."
7442,"Great sounds good, thank you.","Uhm, also sorry before for in the call because the symptoms are started recently and they do uhm, overlap with some of the symptoms that if patient with COVID might have, it might be a good idea to get a COVID swab done as well, so we'll do that today and you would have to quarantine and stay away from the people at your home as well, until the results are out, and then if it's positive, public health will let you know what to do."
7443,"Alright, sounds good. Thank you so much.",Welcome.
7444,"Hi, I am just coming in because for the last couple of months but I've been having this, these coughing fits. Are there like when I'm going to the gym or even at home, like during the weekends when we're vacuuming and cleaning the house.",When did this start?
7445,"Um, I would say started, uh probably 3 months back, but it's gotten worse, so like before I used to like just have some irritation in my throat and cough a little, but now, I would say probably every other day I'm having these episodes where I can't stop coughing when I'm exercising.","Hmm, um and is this cough a dry cough, or do you bring up some mucus?"
7446,"It's usually, it's usually a dry cough and sometimes I do bring up like this light material, but usually it's mostly a dry cough.","You never notice any blood, right?"
7447,"No, no blood.","OK and uhm, it started about three months ago, I guess before that did you ever have a problem when you would exercise or when you were vacuuming or cleaning, has this been a problem that has occurred for years and that's just something that you that got worse and now it's come to your attention? Or was it just very new and sudden, three months ago?"
7448,"Um, it's fairly new. I've never really had this issue before although I have been like so like after the new year in the winter I, I, I wasn't much of the person who ran or exercised a lot. But I, I kind of needed a new goal to become more fit and active. So I notice that, I don't know, maybe that's why like, it is something new that I've been trying, but yeah, it's not been an issue before.","OK, and other than the the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms like a sore throat or itchy eyes? Itchy nose? Stuffy nose or runny nose? Anything like that?"
7449,"No, none of those, but I did it, initially I used to get just an irritation in my throat. But now it's just more of a cough.","OK. Do you have, do you get any pain in your chest at all?"
7450,"Uh, when I'm usually it goes away in 10-15 minutes but when I'm coughing a lot I do get some tightness.",OK. Do you ever feel like you're short of breath when you're coughing or otherwise?
7451,I do find that it's harder to take a breath at those times.,Ok. Uhm and how long do these last for? Episodes last for?
7452,"Probably, uh 15 to 20 minutes and yeah, it's it's mainly just after I like often times over the last few weeks I've had to just stop doing what I'm doing, like exercising and just come home and rest.",Do you feel like your hearts beating really fast when that happens or you're sweating?
7453,"Yeah, yeah, I I feel like it's usually, I don't know if it's because of the exercise, but I have like a Fitbit and it's my my heart rate is much faster.","Uhm, OK. Alright. Have you had any other symptoms so anything, any pain in your belly or any nausea or vomiting?"

7461,"Um no, not really, I've I've been really, umm, I moved back to my parents' home just for a bit right now.",Ok.
7462,"Now, while the University has closed down, and by that I've lived there all my life before, so I don't know if that had anything to do with it.","Do you feel like they may have put new curtains or or like there's old carpets or new a new pet, or something that could have caused some irritation for you?"
7463,"No, but I have noticed that when I when we vacuum. I, I do get some of those symptoms as well. Just more of an irritation mores than the cough.","OK. OK, and do you feel that you're particularly anxious when these episodes are occurring? Do you have any new stressors in life?"
7464,"Uh, no, not really.",Any medical conditions that run in the family?
7465,"Uhm, I don't think so. Not that I know of.","OK, and I guess a little bit more about you. So have you had in the past when you were younger, did you have a rash like eczema or did you have allergic rhinitis where you would sneeze and, to feel ill when you were outside or at certain times of the year? Anything like that?"
7466,"I didn't have a, I didn't have any like exam or rashes, but I do generally have umm, get allergies during the spring time when I go outside.",Do you take any medications for that?
7467,I just take Reactine usually during the spring.,Do you have any other allergies? To food or medications?

7476,Nope.,"Uh, do you drink alcohol or have you ever had alcohol in the past?"
7477,"Yeah, alcohol I've had like at University, but generally, maybe just on the weekends. Not anything regular.","Alright. OK, well, uh, those are all the questions I had for you. We will do a physical exam now and I'll go talk to my attending and we'll uh come talk to you right after. I guess before before I do So what exactly are you hoping to get out of today's visit?"
7478,"I just wanted to like I really do you want to become fit and it's just these symptoms are stopping me and kind of affecting my daily routine, so I just wanted to know what I can do to stop like having these symptoms.",Have you ever tried any puffers?
7479,"No, I haven't.","No, ok. Right, yeah, let's talk a little bit."
7480,"Hey, I just, um, I just kind of came in to talk about my stuffy nose. It's yeah, it's been a problem for, I don't even know how many years it's always been there. And now that school is a little less busy and things are virtual and have more time, I decided I'll get something done, um, to get it fixed.","OK, and how long has this been going on for?"
7481,"Since I was young, um like maybe years, couple years.","OK, and then do you like how often are you getting the stuffiness? Is it like every day? Is it during the day at night? When do you usually get it?"
7482,"It's kind of uhm, it's kind of all the time, to the point that I've somewhat gotten used to it. And it's just my, it's only on the left side and it's just always kind of stuffy. Initially I would have trouble falling asleep 'cause it would, I would just find it a little bit bothersome, but now I'm kind of just used to it.","OK, and so it's just on the left side. It never moves to the right side."
7483,"Well, like sometimes when I get ill its on both sides, but usually it's on the left side.","OK, and so you have stuffiness. But do you ever get any kind of discharge or drainage from your nose?"

7492,"No, it's just there all the time. Like I can't even tell. This is like my normal now, but my mom said I should get it checked out.","OK, uhm. Have you tried anything for it like either medications or the neti pot or steaming and has anything helped you at all?"
7493,"I tried steaming but it didn't do much. It kind of got better. Maybe for an hour maybe, but then yeah, it didn't do much.","OK, and otherwise, are you having any other symptoms like fever, chills, cough, sore throat, anything like that?"

7521,"Oh yeah, it's great.","Ok. So yeah, so mainly yeah. So there's all the questions I had for you. Do you have any questions or concern?"
7522,Nope.,"Ok so there can be many different reasons for this chronic congestion and we'll do a full physical examination for you today. Uh and some of the possible things that can be happening is you might be having a sinus issue like a chronic sinusitis. You can be having an allergic rhinitis or with the snoring and just the chronic congestion. You may be also having something called obstruct, obstructive sleep apnea. And there can be structures in your mouth, throats that can cause you to kind of obstruct and snore at night as well, and that even the congestion might cause that as well. So yeah, we'll do a couple test first and then if required, we might need to do some imaging and even perhaps send you to an EMT specialist if we think it's obstructive sleep apnea there. For now, we'll just do the physical examination to go from there."
7523,"Great, thank you.","Welcome, take care."
7524,"Hey, I'm I'm the mom of, of the patient. He's he's a kid, he has had, he just had a cough and stuffy nose for the past three days.","OK, and so did they both start around the same time or one started before the other?"

There's uh viral infections that can cause some of the symptoms. The symptoms he's having mainly seen viral with a dry cough and runny nose. And then you can we have a rash as well. One thing I forgot to ask actually is is he fully immunized?"
7565,"Um, he I guess he didn't get all his immunizations done earlier. He did get them a little bit later so we came from Syria as refugees. But I I'm thinking he got all his immunizations when he, uh, came to, when we moved to Canada.","OK, and is he complaining of joint or muscle aches at all?"
7566,No.,"No, nothing like that, OK. Alright, so yeah, we'll do it like a full physical examination, and if it's more just a viral, it'll be something that we'll just have to monitor and do supportive care for. But if it's anything else we might need to do further investigations. OK, and we'll just do a COVID swab for him today as well as some of the symptoms overlap with COVID symptoms and you will get the results back in 24 hours to 48 hours and then further instruction from public health."

And sometimes with these viral illnesses, it may take some time for the symptoms to go away, especially the cough. So today we will do a COVID swab test for you today, as a lot of the symptoms overlap and you will receive the result in the next one to two days and be contacted by public health for further instructions. As for management, I think you can take over the counter medications like Tylenol cold, drink lots of fluids and stay hydrated. And if those if your symptoms worsen at all, you can contact us again."

7660,No.,"OK, so yeah, right now one of the main things we want to rule out, especially since you had the sudden shortness of breath today after a history of just recent discharge and the hip fracture or injury, and you're immobilized we need to make sure you haven't developed a clot that has traveled to your lungs. So we'll do a full physical examination and get some blood work done initially and then see if you require any medications for if you need thrombolysis for to break up the clot. We'll, we might do some imaging as well, so yeah, well, we'll just start with that, and then we'll go from there."
7661,Sure.,So you'll be in here for a few hours until we get all those things done and see if you need any admission at all to the hospital.

7666,"Yeah, it's uh, I'm just I feel like I can't, can't quite like breathe fully.","OK, uhm you can't quite breathe fully, so like when you take a deep breath in, you can't expand your lungs fully. Is that what you mean?"
7667,"Yeah, yeah, I just overall I just feel like yeah, I'm I'm short of breath. I guess that's the best way to put it.","OK, so you're short of breath. And how about wheezing? Do you have any of that?"

7684,"No, no, not like that kind of weak. I just have felt like very rundown.",OK.
7685,"Just like just fatigued like more than usual, yeah.",OK. Are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions?
7686,"Uhm, I don't I don't have too much luckily, knock on wood. Uhm, I, I take a medication for my reflux.",Mhmm.

7694,"So I I'm not sure I I know that I always say yes to these things, but I'm not sure because of Covid and stuff if I've been getting everything exactly on time.","Mhmm. OK, and how about uh, how about allergies? Do you have any allergies?"
7695,"Oh, like uh, just seasonal. Not to any medications or anything.","OK. Uhm, have you been in touch with anyone sick recently around you?"
7696,"No, like the only person I see is my husband. I guess him, and so he has a PSW that comes in to take care of him. He has a couple more problems than I do. So basically, we see I see him and her and we see we see our kids, but just like outside.","OK. OK and alright and then, uhm, have you traveled anywhere recently?"
7697,"No, no","No, OK. Dietary wise, are you like eating healthy?"
7698,"Yeah, yeah, I think so. I try to, you know, cook, you know, whole foods for us like lots of veggies and you know fish and good meat. Although in the past you know few days, I just 'cause I felt really rundown and fatigued, I haven't been eating as much as I normally do.",OK.

7704,"No, no we renovated probably 15 years ago, and there's no no more carpet, and there were never any asbestos problems or anything.","OK. OK, well I think those are all the questions that I had. Did you have any questions for myself?"
7705,I don't think so. I just I hope you know we can get this figured out.,"Yeah, for sure. So we'll start with doing a Covid swab because you have some symptoms that overlap with it, so you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results. But it does sound like what you're telling me with the wet cough and you know a little bit of shortness of breath, I think it's worthwhile to get a chest x-ray to see if you might possibly have a pneumonia, and if you do, if there is some consolidation we'll probably prescribe some antibiotics for that. Umm, how does that sound to you?"
7706,"Sounds great to me. Yeah, I just you know, hope there's nothing serious going on.","Yeah, yeah, and it shouldn't be. It's probably 1 something that's been going around in the community and you haven't had any recent hospitalizations or surgery, so I wouldn't worry about like any of those atypical bugs just yet."
7707,"OK, OK, that's good to hear.","Yeah, for sure. Well, uhm, thank you."
7708,"So I've just I had some sinus problems in the past. I've had some sinus infections and I just feel like I have one right now and I know that like I know that you know, a lot of the time I I've done all the things that I've been told to do in the past like I've been doing, like Saline rinses and just doesn't feel like it's helping very much right now. When I rinse, I'm getting like this greenie gross kind of mucus coming out. And it's just like giving me this like headache. It just feels crappy.","Yeah, I'm sorry you're feeling that way. So this runny nose, OK, do you have a cough at all?"
7709,"Uh, no I don't have a cough.",Any shortness of breath?
7710,"Uhm, I don't have a real like shortness of breath, but it does feel congested.","OK, how about wheeziness?"
7711,"Uh, no wheeziness.","No wheeziness, OK. And how about, how about like sore throat or loss of taste?"
7712,"Uhm, uh so my throat not sore in like the way that you get catch a sore throat but I get a lot of post nasal drip and it makes it like stingy. So it's like it's sore in that way, but it's not like you know if you have like strep throat or something.",OK. How about changes in your vision or hearing?
7713,"No, nothing like that.",Weight loss?
7714,No.,Fevers or chills?
7715,"I, I took my temp last night. It was pretty high. It was like 99 point like something, uhm 99 like 7 or something.","Ah, OK."
7716,"So my thermometer said that's high, I don't, I don't really know, but yeah.","OK and how about like, facial pain or pressure or feeling like it's full?"
7717,"Oh yeah, I have that. It's like yeah, all on the front part of my face.","OK. And then you mentioned some nasal obstruction, some discharge and you said no loss of smell, right?"
7718,"No, I didn't lose any smell. Like sometimes it's kind of hard to smell because it's so plugged up.",Right.
7719,"I still have like I'm able to smell like, especially after I do the rinses. It helps a little bit.","OK, how about like a chest pain?"
7720,"Uhm, no, I haven't had any chest pain.","No, OK. Any issues with bowel movements or have those been normal?"
7721,Those have been normal.,OK. Any changes in your urine?
7722,No.,"No, OK. Any headaches?"
7723,"Yeah, like I get that like sinusy headache that you know, it's pretty common for me, like kind of just all in like the front of my face and sometimes it kind of feels like it goes all over.","How about umm, how about like dizziness or fainting?"
7724,No.,"No, OK. Are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions?"
7725,"No, this is pretty well, pretty well the only thing. I had some problems with my knee like I had some problems with the ACL, so like I see like an orthopaedic person for that, but otherwise, otherwise I'm healthy.","OK. OK, uhm, and are you on any medications?"
7726,"No, like I I sometimes like I used this saline rinse.",OK.
7727,"For a bit. I used to use the nasal steroid spray and I I hadn't had an infection for awhile and things were feeling OK, so I haven't been using it recently. Umm, and then I occasionally will use like, like an Advil if my knees sore.","OK. OK, and no hospitalizations or surgeries?"
7728,"Uh, so I had an ACL repair surgery.","Oh right, yeah, OK."
7729,"And like I went to the emergency department once when I had a bad sinus infection, but I didn't like stay over at the hospital.","OK, OK. How about immunizations? Are you up to date?"
7730,I think so. I never really didn't get any.,OK. Any allergies?
7731,"Uh, like a little bit to cats but nothing else.",OK. Any family history of lung or heart conditions?
7732,"No, not that I know of.","OK. How about smoking, do you smoke?"
7733,"No, no.","No, OK. Do you drink alcohol?"
7734,I drink a few beers on the weekend.,OK.
7735,You know five or six per weekend.,"OK. And then, five or six for weekend. OK and any recreational drugs?"
7736,"I will occasionally take like a cannabis, like a capsule like the oil in the capsule.","OK, and what is that for?"
7737,"Just like recreational. Also like I mean my knee, my knee pain. Sometimes it helps.","Mhmm, OK."
7738,But essentially that that might be like once like per month or something.,"OK. OK. Alright, and, any sick contacts recently?"
7739,"No, no. I've been working from home.","OK. OK, and any travel recently?"
7740,No.,"No, OK. And where do you live?"
7741,I live here in town with my wife and our teenage son.,OK. Is anyone at home sick?
7742,"No, they're fine.","They're fine. OK, and what about.. Sorry?"
7743,They're both working from home like doing school from home too. So we rarely don't go anywhere like my wife goes to get groceries and that's about it.,"OK, I see. And any old carpets, smoke, asbestos, mold anything like that at home?"
7744,"No, no, it's a pretty new house.","OK, alright, any pets at home?"
7745,We have a dog. It's a labradoodle.,"OK, yeah."
7746,"And that's it, yeah.",How long have you had him?
7747,"Oh, like, he's like 3 now. Like my sinus infections and that have been going on for longer than we've had him.","OK, alright. Those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for me?"
7748,"I don't think so. I just I hope you know, we can do something about this. Because you know, I tried all this stuff that is supposed to be like, you know, conservative like the first steps and it just doesn't seem like it's getting better. It's been like few weeks. So, I thought it was probably time to come see you.","Yeah, sorry. What have you tried at home again?"
7749,"So I use the, the rinses the saline rinses. I used a little bit of nasal decongestant but I know like I know I've been told I'm not supposed to do that for more than a few days, so I don't. Yeah, that's, I think that's pretty well it 'cause they said there's not much we can really do.","OK, yeah. So your symptoms, OK because some some of these things overlap with Covid, we're going to have to swab you and they'll notify you of your results in like 24 to 48 hours. But what it sounds like is something called Sinu, Sinusitis and it sounds like acute bacterial rhinosinusitis because of some f the symptoms that you have, and it's been going on for more than a week and it's, it's not going away with the rinse, saline rinses and these decongestants. So we will prescribe some antibiotics for you. Probably amoxicillin. Take those for five to seven days and see if some of your symptoms clear up. If they continue to be severe, umm, actually, at this will also prescribe you some inhaled corticosteroids because I think those can help as well, so will give you both of those for now and then just follow up with us in a week after you've tried both things and we'll see how your symptoms are holding up at that point. Does that sound like a good plan to you?"
7750,"Yeah, I think that sounds that sounds fair. Yeah, thank you.","OK, yeah no problem."
7751,"I I've been having uh, this fever, the last couple of days and I've had a cough as well and my nose is, keeps running.",OK. And when did the fevers start?
7752,I think the fever started two days ago.,"How, did you measure your magic temperature?"
7753,"Yeah, it was 38 point .5 when I when I checked it.",And have you been checking it out past days? Has it gotten better or worse?
7754,It's been about the same both both days.,"And your cough, when did that start?"
7755,Cough started four days ago.,"OK, is it a wet cough or dry cough?"
7756,It's been dry.,I've been bringing up any blood or any mucus or anything like that.
7757,"No, and I haven't had a cough before either. This is new.","OK, and the runny nose, what kind of discharge, or what like what's coming out of your nose?"
7758,It's pretty pretty watery and clear.,"OK, alright, and when did that start?"
7759,"Yeah, yeah, sorry that started about four days ago as well, so about the same time as the cough.","Have you had any other symptoms, such as having a stuffy nose that have congestion in your sinuses, sore throat? Umm, red eyes? Watery, teary eyes? Sneezing, any of those symptoms."
7760,"Um, no nothing like that.",Any difficulties breathing?
7761,No.,Any pain in your chest?
7762,No.,"OK, any headaches?"
7763,"Uh yeah I have had a bit of a headache, actually. Well, just just this morning.",How how bad is it?
7764,"It's pretty mild. Something pretty simple like it, so I've had headaches like like this before. It's not, it's not a big deal.",And do you have any fatigue or muscle aches?
7765,"No muscle aches, but yeah, I have been fatigued last a couple of days. Two or three days.",Any changes in your sense of smell?
7766,No.,Changes in your sense of taste?

7771,"No, I'm not.","OK, and allergies to food or medications, or environmental allergies?"
7772,"I think I have an allergy to penicillin. I got it, I had a rash when I was I younger when I had that.","OK, and do you currently? Would you currently let that?"

7774,"No, it's just us two, uh, we live in a in a townhouse in in the city.","Nice, OK. And do you do you or your mom go out for school or for work?"
7775,"Uh yeah, I've been going been going to school. I know with the some of the lockdowns and what not the schools been open so we've been going. They've been pretty cautious with the covid protocols. And but my mom's been working from home.","OK, good. Do you feel like you or your mom may have had contact with anyone who could have potentially been sick?"
7776,"Uhm, I mean, maybe at the school or something like that, but I can't think of anybody who who's been sick.","OK, alright, have you traveled anywhere outside the province?"
7777,No.,"OK, uhm. And, uh, do you I guess a couple of other more general questions. Do you feel safe at home?"
7778,"I do, yeah. We have a good a good relationship.","I'm glad, I'm glad, and an anything that we discuss will see confidential between you and me, unless there's something that you could be talk about that could harm you or harm anyone else. Do you feel safe at school?"
7779,"Yes, I do. I enjoy school. It's been fun.","That's good, that's good. And have you can have been consuming the drug? Tried anything?"
7780,"No, I've heard of other people. I mean in high school doing stuff like that, but I haven't been around anything like that.","OK, alright. Any alcohol?"
7781,No.,"OK, are you sexually active?"
7782,No.,"Alright. And uh, let's see so.. uh, you've had a fever, a cough, and a runny nose for the past few days. And have you been going to school? In the past couple of days or no?"
7783,"I know I've taken the last couple of days off, just been so tired and not feeling good so, yeah well.","OK, OK. So yeah, it sounds like you might have some sort of viral infection which could potentially be covid, but could also be another sort of another viral illness, just like the common cold or the flu. Um, so I'll request that we get a covid swab done and the results should come back in 24 to 48 hours and um, just try to self isolate as much as possible. Don't go to school, don't meet other people. Try to stay away from your mom as well. And based on the results, you'll get more guidance from public health nurses, and you should just continue to sort of rest and drink lots of water. Maybe take Tylenol or Advil if that's making you feel better and hopefully your symptoms will get better. If not, if you feel like your symptoms are persisting for days or week or so, or you're having worsening symptoms, definitely come back or give us a call."
7784,"I'm just bringing my son today because he's been how many episodes where I'm eat hell gets all this coughing fit and become wheezy and become shorter breath and I mean after a period of time it goes away, but it's been happening every so often.",Does he still have these symptoms?
7785,"Like right now he's OK. When the symptoms come on, they last for I don't know, maybe 30 minutes, 60 minutes or or even less. But yeah it happens maybe once or twice a week where and it's been going on for a, a couple of months now. Yeah, he actually had a viral infection like a few months ago and I thought it was just that. It leared up and then he's just had a few more of these episodes, but without those kind of symptoms so.",Hm? So all this started a couple months ago.
7786,Yeah.,Do you find that there and you mentioned that it happens about one to two times a week? Is there anything specific happening at that time? Any triggers that result in these symptoms?
7787,"Well I will say I think I like exercise. I find yeah like soccer practice. Yeah, after maybe, or even during a game, like when things are really intense. Yeah, I think during soccer I've I've kind of noticed it. And then at night time as well. It kind of randomly, he'll have this cough.",OK. So I guess it's do you feel like it's affected by cold weather as well or no?
7788,"Um, maybe yeah, like if he yeah completely in the winter time. Like I know when he goes outside if he yeah he takes like a deep breath or something like that. He'll talk about having shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in the cold weather.","OK, other than the and I guess the cough. Is he coughing up anything, or is it kind of a dry cough?"
7789,It's dry.,OK. Does he have any like chest pain during these episodes.
7790,"No, he hasn't said anything like that.","Alright, any fevers?"
7791,"No, he had a little bit of a fever at the that one time a few months ago, but he hasn't. So that's right. I think he had a some sort of illness then, but he hasn't had any fevers.","I see. OK, any headaches?"
7792,"No, he hasn't said anything like that.",OK. And how has he had any other symptoms so anything like racing heart or belly pain or muscle aches or any changes in his bowel movements or urinary symptoms?
7793,"Uh no, I haven't heard him, uh, I complain about anything like that. I think I'll everything like that's been normal.","OK. So when he has these episodes, how like how severe are they? So how difficult is it for him to breathe?"
7794,"Ah, well, you certainly when it first starts, I mean for the first minute or two. Yeah, he that when I think particularly at soccer practice school have a really hard time catching his breath, but like he would, he stops playing and rests and really tries to make sure that he is I don't know, just trying to to breathe and it kind of goes away. He's been able to manage it OK.","OK, alright and I have these symptoms that have interfered with his daily activities? Does he for instance, try to avoid soccer practice. Or does he have difficulties falling asleep at night?"
7795,"Yeah, definitely wakes him up a few and every once in awhile at night and he does have to take it a little easier at soccer for sure. So yeah, I am thinking it is affecting him.","OK. And otherwise has he been, has he had any medical conditions that he's been diagnosed with?"
7796,"Uh, no, well he had some rashes when he was younger that he would get some some creams for, but that's mostly resolved now.","OK, any hospitalizations or surgeries?"
7797,"No, he hasn't had anything like that.","OK, uhm. And just going back to his birth and your pregnancy, were there any complications at the time of pregnancy?"
7798,"Um, there was a prolonged labor, I think, but he was delivered vaginally and at term","OK. OK, that's great."
7799,"And he, oh sorry, I was just going to say normal weight as well.","OK good has, was he kept in the in ICU for a couple of days after, was he sent home?"
7800,"I think they, like he was kept for not an ICU he was kept for one day I think so just monitor for infection because it was like prolonged labor but he was OK. OK, so yeah we were able to go home.","OK, and I, what was I going to say. Forgot what I was going to say. How yeah, how has this growth and development been? Has he been seeing his doctor regularly? Any concerns there?"
7801,Yeah he's been good with with growth. No concerns for that and his developments been normal as well. He's reached all of his milestones.,"OK, and is he going to school?"
7802,"Yeah, yeah, he's been going to school. He hasn't really been, he hasn't missed well he's missed one or two days actually, because of the cough, like on nights that he just didn't sleep well, so in the morning he's just well, not not feeling good for school so he has missed a couple of days over the last few months.","Okay. And does he, is there any other any conditions that run in the family? Including things like asthma or eczema, or allergic rhinitis or allergies."
7803,"Yeah, sister does have some bad allergies. Her nose runs all the time and she also has that asthma. His sister uses and a daily inhaler and then also W1.","I see. OK, and uh. How are things at home is he, is he doing well otherwise? Like at school and things like that, any stressors in his life?"
7804,"No, he's been doing, uh, he's been doing well at school. He likes math and that that's been going, well.","OK, great. Has he ever tried any puffers?"
7805,"No, he hasn't actually.",Has he been on any medications?
7806,"Um, he he has not.",Any allergies that he has?
7807,"Not that I'm aware of, but I I think he might. I mean so like environmental or I don't know, something. He does get symptoms like a runny nose and itchy eyes sometimes, but usually go away pretty pretty quickly and he doesn't fuss about it too much so, yeah so.","From the symptoms that you've described so far, it sounds like he might also have asthma, but we will obviously have to do some testing and confirm that. Uhm, and also, it's given sort of the results, or even just like giving his symptoms, prescribe some buffers to help with those symptoms. Clearly it's affecting his life. He can't go to school or can't participate in soccer, or sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night, and that's not good. So, we'll we can be prescribed some puffers and see if those help and also get some testing done. Do you have any other questions for me?"
7808,"Uhm, No, yeah I was just wondering about, so like the wheezing and all of that could be with from asthma too?","Uhm, yeah, I would think so, but again, we'll get the testing done and see if there are any other, any other causes."
7809,Ok.,You said the wheezing sort of lasts only 30 to 30 minutes to an hour and then gets better?
7810,"Yeah, I don't notice that any other times.","Yes, it's possibly, I mean, I would think it's asthma, but then we'll get the testing done and see."
7811,"Yeah, I've had a shortness of breath, and even at at rest. Really, feeling like it's difficult to breathe, and when I take a deep breath I get a chest pain.",When did this start?
7812,This started yesterday.,How bad is your shortness of breath?
7813,"Like, I don't know. I feel like I'm OK, like n terms of being able to breathe, but I mean if I exert myself at all, there's no way I would be able to. It's, I just feel like even at rest it's hard to breathe.","OK, has it gotten worse since yesterday or better, or kind of been the same?"
7814,"It's mostly been that been the same or actually sorry it's got, got a little bit worse at first. It was more more with exertion, and now it's, at rest as well. So yeah, it's got worse.","I see, OK. Are you able to talk in full sentences or do you need to take a deep like stop to take a breath?"
7815,I could talk in full sentences.,"And the chest pain, does it only occur when you take a deep breath, or are there other times as well?"
7816,"I pretty much yeah only when I'm taking a deep breath and say, I mean, maybe that's why part of the I can't take a deep breath so it's making me feel it's making the breathing more difficult making me feel more short of breath.",OK. Any other symptoms that you've had? A fever or headache?
7817,"No, nothing like that.",Any cough?
7818,"Yeah, I, I've had a cough as well over that the same same time period.",Is it a dry cough? Are you bringing something up?
7819,"It's dry, yeah, I haven't brought up any sputum or any any any blood.","OK any other flu like symptoms, runny nose, stuffy nose, sore throat? Anything like that?"
7820,"No, I just had um, yeah, the shortness of breath and chest pain.","OK, uhm. And have you, I guess I just invited more general questions about others potential symptoms. Do you feel like your heart is racing or do you feel like you have, uhm, do you have any belly pain or any changes in your bowel movements?"
7821,"No belly pain or changes to bowel movements, but I do feel like my heart is beating really fast really fast though.","Yeah, OK. Uhm, you said this started yesterday. Were you like completely fine the day before?"
7822,Uh I was yeah.,Anything that's happened recently that's different or new?
7823,"I'm well it like uh, about two weeks ago I had a hysterectomy 'cause I, for abnormal bleeding. Yeah I had surgery 2 weeks ago.",What have you been doing these past two weeks in terms of sort of physical activity? Have you been moving around or no?
7824,"It's it's certainly been less I I've been moving a little bit, but I've had a lot of pain so I just haven't been doing as much activity, that's for sure.","I I see and have you had any, I guess any pain in your legs. Or swelling in your leg? One or the other?"
7825,"Yeah, I have had actually, yeah my right my right calf is pretty sore.",Definitely have a look at that. Have you noticed that it's been bigger or more red or warm?
7826,"Um, no, I don't notice anything like that, just I, just really hurts.","Uh, OK. Any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?"
7827,"Um, yeah, yeah and I have a high BMI. Type 2 diabetes and anxiety.",Do you have any bleeding disorders?
7828,"Um other yeah, no. I think you're right. It said fibroids.","OK, OK. And do you take any medication?"
7829,"Yeah, so uh insulin, well metformin. And then that's it.",OK.
7830,"I'm sorry and then an SSRI. Like I said, low pram for anxiety.",Alright. And do you have any allergies?
7831,"No, I don't.","And, who do you.. do you currently live alone?"
7832,"Uh no, I live with my husband and and our two sons.","OK and, do you, have anyone sort of come in to help you out over these past two weeks? Are you getting any outside help from nurses etc. Or are your are your family members being supportive and helpful?"
7833,"Yeah, it's been mostly the the family members. My husband's been working from home and the kids have been helpful as well. They are 10 and 12 so they are able to do some things on their own so yeah they've been supportive.","That's great. That's great. OK, and you smoke at all?"
7834,I do yes I I smoke about a half a pack per day.,For how long?
7835,"Um, yeah, but I I started in my, yeah, after the kids were born actually, uh so like 10 years ago.","OK, have you tried cutting it down at all?"
7836,"Yeah, I have. I've kind of gone through spurts of quitting and restarting, quitting and restarting. So yeah, I've tried before.","OK, and what about marijuana or recreational drugs?"
7837,"No, don't use anything like that.",And alcohol?
7838,"Yeah I'll have some wine on the on the weekends, but maybe that's like a glass or two.","OK, OK uhm, and do you have any medical conditions that long run in the family?"
7839,"Just, uh, yeah, my father actually had a stroke when he was 68, and that's it.","OK OK uhm. You haven't ever had one, have you?"
7840,"No, I I haven't had anything like that.","OK, alright. So. I guess come to in terms of smoking, you said that you've tried to quit a couple of times in the past. Do you intend on trying again? I know it can be very hard to, to quit smoking."
7841,"Yeah, it's only something that is always kind of in the back of my mind.","OK, if there's I'm happy to assist you and share resources and problems like medications and things like that that could help you if you're interested so we can talk more about that. talking about your I guess you mentioned that your weight is a little higher than or, its outside the normal range, is that something that you would like to cut down?"
7842,"Yeah, I really try to eat more vegetables and have been trying to do that sort of thing. I've lost a few pounds, but not enough, definitely want to keep going.","OK, good good, as long as you feel that you what you're currently doing is helping you and is helping you reduce weight. That's great. But also I'm here for you if you need more education or guidance on that. So, given what you've told me so far, it sounds like you might have developed a clot in your leg somewhere, simply because you had a surgery and you were not moving around very much. Sometimes that causes the blood to kind of, not move around your body is as as much as it usually does, and kind of stays in one place and get turned into a clot and that clot can sometimes get dislodged and settle into your lungs, and that can make it difficult for you to breathe. So, we'll do some tests that that's what my understanding is. Given what you've told me so far, but we do have to confirm it using a test. Also, the fact that you smoke and your weight, and your BMI is high, increases your risk of developing a clot, so I would definitely strongly recommend that you continue to try to reduce both and try to quit smoking. And so we'll do an ultrasound of your leg and we'll do a scan of your chest and see what's going on and then decide if we need to give you any medications, like any blood thinning medications."
7843,"OK, yeah, that sounds really good. Thank you.",Welcome.
7844,"So two days ago I started to have this cough. Came out of nowhere. I haven't had a cough before and I, just today I've noticed the fever as well and and I've had a headache the last few days.",Can you tell me a little bit more about your cough? Has it gotten better or worse over the past two days?
7845,"So it, it's a it's been about.. well, it got worse at first and then it's been about the same since then.","Okay, and is it dry cough or wet cough?"
7846,It's dry.,Okay. Uhm? And does it ever wake you up at night?
7847,"No. Well, it kind of happens all throughout the day. Yeah, no, no, it hasn't woken me up at night.","OK, is there any, are there any triggers? Anything that makes your cough worse?"
7848,I can't think of anything really. It just kinda comes on like throughout the day on it spontaneously.,How do you take any medications to help with your symptoms?
7849,"Yeah, some over the counter cold medicines. I tried some to take Tylenol cold and sinus or something like that anyway and it did help me sleep a little bit with that the headache and just haven't been feeling very good, to help with that.","And tell me about your fever. Did you check it check it, check your temperature?"
7850,"I did yeah today I checked it and it was, like just over 38 I think like 38.1 or two.","OK, what about your headache? Where exactly is it?"
7851,I kind of feel it all over. It's like a band night feels like it's just around my head and squeezing.,"And, how like if you had to give it a number from one to 10? What number would you give it? With 10 being the worst headache ever?"
7852,I would say maybe a 5.,"OK, and you mentioned that the Tylenol helped."
7853,"It did, yeah, probably took it down to a two or three. The headache didn't go away entirely. It was sort of still there, but did help.",Have you had any other symptoms?  Have you had a confusion or is it any fuzziness? Or any flu like symptoms?
7854,"Uh, I have felt just tired and, over these last couple of days. That and I have had a sore throat as well.","Oh, you get OK. OK, what about a runny nose or stuffy nose?"

7871,"Yeah, sometimes, well, we'll smoke with like friends at a party I guess, but I haven't had any. I haven't done that in awhile.",Alright. Any alcohol?
7872,"Similar like sometimes at a party, but I mean yeah, it's been awhile for something like that, so I haven't really had any alcohol on in months.","And are you currently working, or?"
7873,"I am yeah. So it's uh, yeah I work for this tech company so I've been able to do a lot of my stuff at at home.","OK, uhm. Have you had any exposures to anyone who could potentially be sick?"
7874,"I will without, well, yeah I there a couple or last weekend. Actually there was a family party that we went to. It was outside, but uh, it, yeah, there's people around. There was nobody that was sick that I'm aware of.",OK. And and have you traveled anywhere outside the province?

7876,"Yeah, I said some actually now that you mention it right sense of smell has been different, which is kind of weird, 'cause I I don't have, everybody knows or I don't feel congested or anything. So yeah, but my taste has been OK.","Good. Well, that's all the questions I had for you. Given that your symptoms sort of sound like you may have a viral or bacterial infection and seeing that you were, you had some exposure to to other people even though they weren't sick, it could, it could be that they, they had some sort of an illness that they could transmit that they weren't just showing symptoms at the time. We will get a covid swab done just to make sure that that's not what's happening. It could be that. And I'll recommend that you continue to, you know, take Tylenol and rest and take care of yourself and if your symptoms worsen or stay the same for long period of time, definitely come back or call public health to get some guidance and try to stay away from others and self isolate for the next couple of days or at least clear covid swabs back or your symptoms improve. Or the next 14 days. So that's all I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me?"
7877,"I'm I'm here because I, I've oddly been feeling really short of breath and have a fever or and a cough.","OK, when did the shortness of breath start and are you short of breath now?"

I thought that I was just getting a cold. But now that it's happened like three times, I'm thinking maybe you have some sort of an allergy like maybe,  I don't know. Maybe it's like yeah, I'm just allergic to something. Maybe his plants or something. I don't know.","OK, and it does this happen each time that you go go to his house?"

7924,"I don't think so, no.","OK, so it sounds like there's potentially could be caused by an allergen such as which could be   from an animal like a parrot or a cat that is causing just a reaction and it's bringing these symptoms on like called hypersensitivity pneumonitis, but also we can't rule out asthma as well as being a trigger of kind of the cough and shortness of breath is being around allergens as well, so we'll order pulmonary function test, and maybe some, uh, uh, imaging and chest x-ray and we will go from there."

8125,"She did, yeah, she got better. Right uh, last week we we had to take her to to see the doctor and she got antibiotics for that. Actually for, for a few days.","OK, OK. And have you traveled anywhere recently?"
8126,"No, we've been at home.",OK. Does anyone at home smoke?
8127,No.,"No, OK. And who lives at home with him?"
8128,"So it's me, his mom, and then his younger sister.","OK. Any old carpets, mold, dust, asbestos, anything that could exacerbate his condition?"
8129,"No, I don't think so. It's a newer home.","OK, good. Umm, so those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?"
8130,"Uhm, no, I, no that was everything I think. The only I I guess other thing that that I forgot to mention is that just he doesn't really like his appetite's been a little bit lower couple of days as well. But uh, he hasn't had any, like nausea or vomiting though.","OK, OK, yeah, that's good to know. Uhm, so because some of his symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will do a swab on him and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results and he should isolate for 14 days because of those symptoms. And it doesn't, it sounds more in keeping with the picture of community acquired pneumonia, so for that we will get a chest x-ray, we'll check his oxygen and his temperature and if the chest x-ray shows consolidation umm, or some sort of infiltrate, it is likely that he has pneumonia. So, we will start by giving him some amoxicillin populate or cefuroxime for five days, and just keep monitoring his symptoms. They should resolve in about 5 days when the course of antibiotics is complete. If his condition gets worse like he's getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, just take him to the ER. And if symptoms don't resolve in five to seven days, we can do further work up or things like fungal infections or TB, or things like that. How does that sound?"
8131,That sounds great. Thank you.,"OK, yeah, no problem."
8132,"Yeah so I'm bringing in my year old son here with, I because he's had a fever and and a cough and a runny nose. These symptoms have been going on now for the last two days.","Last two days. OK. Uhm, all of these symptoms have been going on for the last two days or just like one or two?"
8133,"I think, I think the cough and runny nose started 1st and then he then he kind of had some fever and had some chills as well last night. Kept saying that, like he was just cold, even though he had a had blankets on.","OK. OK. Alright, so the cough is it a productive cough or is it a dry cough?"
8134,It's dry.,"Dry, OK. So no sputum, no blood?"
8135,No no no sputum or blood.,Any shortness of breath with that?
8136,"No, his breathing has been been good.","OK, wheeziness?"
8137,No.,Chest pain?
8138,"No, no.","OK. The fever, did you measure it yourself?"
8139,"I did. Yeah it was 38 point, ah point 8.","OK, and the runny nose is it clear? Or does it have like a colour to it like yellow or green?"
8140,"It's pretty, yeah it's more clear.","Clear, OK. Alright and does he feel like he also has a stuffy nose or is it just a runny nose?"
8141,More just runny. Yeah he doesn't mention anything about feeling stuffy.,"OK. Any symptoms like redness, any discharge?"
8142,"Uh, no, yeah, uh, he hasn't had any any eye symptoms.","OK, how about hearing wise?"

8148,No.,No. Sore throat?
8149,"Yeah, yeah, he's had a bit of a sore throat.",OK.
8150,"But he hasn't he's just kind of mentioned it. He said it wasn't too bad. He's still been been eating. Eating is that hasn't been eating as much, but he's got a poor appetite, but he, so this sore throat isn't bugging him that much that much.",OK. And how about dizziness or fainting spells?
8151,No.,"No, OK. Numbness or tingling?"
8152,No.,Muscle ache or joint pains?
8153,"Yeah, yeah he has had uh, he did mention that he just feels like a key a little bit all over.","OK, any changes in his bowel movements?"
8154,No diarrhea.,"No, OK. Natural vomiting?"
8155,"No, he hasn't had any nausea or vomiting.","OK, uhm how about changes to his appetite?"
8156,"Yeah, his appetite's been a bit down, yeah.",Is he still eating solids?
8157,"He is, yeah, he's still eating solids just a little bit. Probably just just smaller portions though.","OK, yeah. And ah, are there any changes to his urine?"
8158,"No, there there hasn't been any any changes to his hearing.","OK. Uhm, any past medical illnesses or any longstanding medical conditions that he has?"
8159,"No, he's he's been um he's been pretty healthy. Yeah, I mean, he's got got gets a cold every once in awhile maybe in the winter, but that's about it.","OK, any hospitalizations or surgeries?"
8160,"Uh, no, he's been healthy.",OK. Any complications with his mother's pregnancy with him?
8161,"No, it's been ah it was normal pregnancy throughout it was to term and it was a C-section delivery but that went well and he was a normal weight.",OK. And was it an emergency C-section?
8162,"Ah no. I think it was like Labor was taking, it was prolonged, I mean so it they ended up deciding to just convert throughout. It wasn't an emergency, but like they could have waited a bit longer they were saying but just kind of what went made the decision.","OK, OK. And is he on any medications?"
8163,"Uh, no he's not.","No, OK. And developmental wise has he been hitting all his milestones for like motor movements, speech, behaviour, social, socialization wise?"
8164,"He has yeah, he's been meeting all of his milestones for that, for that.","OK, good. Is he up to date with his immunizations?"
8165,"He is, yeah.",OK. Does he have any allergies?
8166,"Uh, no, no allergies.","OK, any family history of lung or heart conditions?"
8167,"Uh, no, it his grandfather had high blood pressure and like high cholesterol, but that's that's it.","OK. And has he been in contact with sick, sick people recently."
8168,"Uh no, I don't think so. Yeah.","No, OK. And and any travel recently?"

8171,So he lives with myself as well as his his mom and then he's got a younger brother and a younger sister as well.,"OK. And at home. any reason to think that old carpet, dust, mold, asbestos, anything like that could be making his symptoms worse?"
8172,"I don't think so, yeah, it's been all that's been OK.","OK, and and those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?"
8173,"No, I I I just wanted to figure out what this was.","OK, yeah, so it sounds or actually I should start by saying we should get a Covid swab on him just in case it is Covid because some of his symptoms overlap with those symptoms of Covid. Umm, you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with the results of those swabs. And in the meantime, it could be another viral infection that's going around at this time of year. And from the sounds of it, you said he has a fever. He's coughing and he has a runny nose and has muscle aches. It could also be the flu. Regardless of what kind of viral and viral infection he has, the best way to manage it right now is just supportive care, so making sure he's hydrated, eating foods with a lot of nutrition and just keep an eye on his symptoms. If it gets worse or if it's very severe and he has focal neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, take him to the ER right away. How does that sound?"
8174,"Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.",Yeah no problem.
8175,"Uh, I've had this cough. It's been going on now for like last six months or so and been losing some weight as well. I've lost, I think like 20 or 30 pounds in the last six months.","OK, yeah, that's a lot of weight. So the weight loss, you said 20 to 30 pounds?"

8178,"Well, I've had a cough before, uh, like a smokers cough. Ah, and that's been like a few couple of years, but that's just a cough that I would have in the morning and it would just go away but I mean around six months ago I started having this cough all day.","Hm, OK.

8229,"Uhm, no, I was just like, well, really worried that I I could have lung cancer.","Yeah, for sure. So that is quite high on my differential right now just because of your age, your smoking history and just the way you're presenting. So we're gonna do a couple of things. We're going to do a Covid swab just to rule that out. You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but we will do investigations for lung cancer, so we'll start by doing a chest x-ray just to look for a mass or effusions and then from there if we think there are signs of cancer, we can do a CT. Umm, as well we can like stage with the Pet CT after we take a biopsy and send it off for pathology and that should give us more answers as to if you have cancer and if you do have cancer, what type of cancer so that we can talk about treatment plans and kind of what the prognosis is with those particular types of cancers? How does that sound?"
8230,"Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you so much.","OK yeah, no problem."

8269,I was just well worried about Covid and was just wondering what I should do.,"Yeah, for sure. So we are, you're a lot of your symptoms do overlap with those of Covid, so we are going to take a swab today and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but you should isolate for 14 days. And that includes from family family members if possible. Uhm, and basically just keep an eye on your symptoms. If they get worse, or you're having like neurological symptoms, you should seek help from the ER, but otherwise keep yourself hydrated, eat well. If you have a humidifier in the basement, use it, and for your fevers you can take antipyretics like Tylenol. And just it's it's just a lot of supportive care. How does that sound and obviously like if your symptoms aren't going away after like a few weeks, call us back and it could be something like bacterial, in which case we can give you some antibiotics."
8270,"OK yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.","Yeah, no problem."
8271,"Hi, umm, so I've had a sore throat for the past three days and it doesn't seem to be getting any better, and I've also had a fever.

Um alright, so it's sounding like most likely this would be strep throat or, or Group A strep pharyngitis with, because you have no cough, and with a high fever and swelling that you've been redness that you notice in the back of your mouth. And so we'll do a rapid strep antigen test and it will require just a throat swab. To see, to to detect for that, however with a, uh, umm, yeah, I guess that's it. That's what I yeah, well, we'll start with with that now and it could potentially be something like uhm, a viral illness, but that's lower on the on the differential then the bacterial infection is right now. And because of COVID it will be, we'll do a swab as well because people can get fever and sore throat with with COVID as well."

Get a chest X Ray. And if it is tuberculosis, it will require a prolonged course of antibiotics, so that I'll be over several months. Umm, and so I we'll get the infectious disease team involved to help kind of guide our management with the appropriate antibiotic choice, if it does come back to be tuberculosis."

8423,"Uh, no, that was kind of it. What should I do for him?","Uhm, so it's it sounds like the most likely diagnosis now is something called Croup or laryngeal tracheal bronchitis, which is basically a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract areas, and so it can cause had a barky cough and stridor and fever. And so, if so, it's really supportive care and unless he decompensate's and becomes really short of breath and worse, in which case we could, the treatment would be steroids and uhm, possibly utilizing other other things as well, depending on his symptoms, but usually it will be steroids and maybe some oxygen as well. But if he stays relatively stable, then it's mostly supportive care, just making sure he's hydrated as much as possible, you could use like humidified air. Sometimes like a hot shower. That sort of thing can maybe help relieve the cough at night."
8424,OK.,"But umm, that's about it."

8474,"No, nothing else I I I was just wondering what I could do to feel better or make this go away.","Yeah, certainly. So, I, so it's sounds like you have the common cold or a viral illness, which it could be caused by something like adenovirus or there are others as well. However, the symptoms do overlap with COVID. As you can be like nonspecific symptoms, such as having kind of just like a runny nose like you do here, and so we will do a COVID swab and we'll await those results, but in the meantime it's mostly supportive care, so it means just trying to stay hydrated, stay rested. And just monitor your symptoms because if things do get worse, it'll be important to, uh, go to the emergency room."
8475,OK.,"Alright, so we'll get the swab now and get that testing started."
8476,"OK, that sounds great, thank you.","Alright, thank you."

It's been a few days.","Yeah, for sure uhm so it sounds like you may have a viral infection, and because your symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will do a Covid swab on you just to rule that out. Uhm, but from the sounds of what your symptoms are, it, it is most likely to be a common cold, in which case you can just manage it with a lot of hydration, nutrition, good sleep. But if your symptoms get worse or they're not going away after a couple of weeks, or you're having neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, you should get help from the ER. Does that sound OK?"
8523,"Yeah, for sure I haven't had any any symptoms like that, so so far, so that's good.","Yeah for sure. Alright, take care."

In the meantime, you should isolate for for about 14 days and if your symptoms get worse, go to the ER and if you're experiencing things like weakness, seizures like, and you're not getting any better in a couple of weeks, or you feel dehydrated. Otherwise, supportive care at home, keeping yourself hydrated, eating well, sleeping well, all of those will definitely help as well. Does that sound OK?"

8617,"Uhm, in heard from anyone that's been sick. We we kind of have a rule that if you know if we feel sick then not to, not to show up just because, like you know, when we're when we're drinking and like smoking, we may share like a joint, so it's not like we don't want to get everyone sick if one person is sick.","Yeah for sure. Uhm, that makes sense. Alright, any travel recently?"
8618,No.,"No, OK. And where do you live right now?"
8619,Right now I just live in an apartment by myself just outside of London.,"OK. Any old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos anything that could make your condition worse?"

8621,"Uh no, I don't think so, I just wanted to see what this might be.","Yeah, for sure. Uhm so, we are going to do a Covid swab on you because a lot of your symptoms do align with those of Covid, so we just want to rule that out first, so you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Uhm, in the meantime you should isolate for two weeks and if it's not Covid, it could be another viral infection that's been going around this time of year. Either way, kind of management plan is the same, so make sure you're hydrated, eat well, sleep well, and if your symptoms become worse, severe or there any red flags like you have neurological symptoms, like seizures or weakness where you can move your limbs, you should seek help from the ER. How does that sound?"
8622,OK. That sounds good. Thank you.,"OK yeah, no problem."
8623,"Hi, I was just really worried. My son just yesterday night I noticed that he was making these grunting noises and I did notice that he was a bit warm yesterday as well, and today I, he just hasn't been himself, just very, very irritable, crying a lot. Yeah, I just got bit worried.","Yeah, for sure. What started first?"
8624,"I would say the there was a little bit of coughing earlier, like yesterday. But then later on during the night, it kind of turned into this grunting noise, and he's kind of like his chest is moving a lot more when he's taking a breath in and all that.",OK. Uhm did you measure his temperature at home?
8625,"Yeah, so I think it was 38.5 degrees Celsius.","OK, and did you do that orally or rectal or under armpit?"
8626,I did it under the armpit.,"OK. OK, uhm so you mentioned that he's had a fever, he's been grunting and he just seems a little bit more fussy. Is that right?"
8627,Yeah.,OK is he coughing at all?
8628,He was yesterday but not really now.,OK and was it a dry cough?
8629,"I think so. I mean, not-nothing really came out.","OK, that's good. So no blood, no sputum?"
8630,No.,"OK, and did he seem wheezy?"
8631,"Uh, no.","No, OK. So there's no wheezing with the grunting?"
8632,"Maybe a little bit like that, just a little bit of a noise, but it's mostly the grunting.",OK. Has he had any weight loss?
8633,"No, not that I really, we haven't really weighed him now since his last appointment.",OK. Does he seem excessively tired or fatigued?
8634,"Uhm, moreso today I would say he's like earlier, he was very fussy, but now he seems a bit more tired.",OK. Any rashes that you've noticed?
8635,No.,"No, OK. Uhm any changes in his vision or hearing?"
8636,"Uh, no, not that I can tell.","No, OK. So he's responding to like sounds and he's still looking at you and things like that?"
8637,Yeah.,OK. Have you noticed a runny nose or stuffy nose?
8638,"Uhm, no, nothing like that.","No, OK. And he said he hasn't had any like fainting spells?"
8639,"Uh, no, I don't think so.","No, OK. And how many wet diapers is he producing in a day now?"
8640,Probably 5 or 6.,5 or 6 OK. Has that changed from before?
8641,"No, it's pretty much the same.","OK, and uhm any changes to his bowel movements?"
8642,No.,No. How about his urine?
8643,No.,"No, OK. OK. And then you said he was fussy, is he still eating and drinking OK?"
8644,"Uh no, today he's not really taking anything in, like very fussy, very hard to feed him today.","OK, is he crying a lot?"
8645,"Earlier today was crying a lot, but now has calm down and just I guess tired himself out.","Yeah, OK. Alright, and is he an otherwise healthy child?"
8646,"Yeah he was, he was premature by three weeks so, Other than that like I remember when he was born they did have earlier some issues with his oxygen not being high enough and they had to like keeping, keep us in the hospital for a bit longer.",OK.
8647,"But yeah, after that, like there haven't really been too many concerns.","OK, so he's hitting all the developmental milestones like in terms of motor movements, ah speech, behaviour, all of that?"
8648,"Yeah, no issues there so far.","OK, and how about medications? Is he on any?"
8649,No.,"No medications, OK. And is up to date with all his immunizations?"
8650,"Yeah, oh he had all his immunizations so far.",OK. How about allergies? Does he have any?
8651,Not that I know of.,"No, OK. Any family history of lung or heart conditions?"
8652,No.,"OK, and does anyone at home smoke?"
8653,"No, no one smokes.",OK. Has he been in contact with anyone sick recently?
8654,"Uh, no, not that I know of. Uhm his older sister does go to school though, but I don't know if she might have carried something home.","OK, how old is she?"
8655,She's six years old.,"Six, OK. And is she healthy or is she having similar symptoms?"
8656,"No, she's healthy. No, no symptoms.",OK. Any travel recently?
8657,No.,"No, OK. And who does he live with at home?"
8658,"Uh, so his older sister, me and his mother.","OK, any reasons to believe like you have old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets, anything like that that could worsen his symptoms?"
8659,"Uh, no nothing like that.","OK, so I think those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or any concerns? Anything that I missed that you wanted to add?"
8660,"No, I think that was all.","OK, uhm so for him we'll do a Covid swab just to rule that out because some of his symptoms do overlap with that. But it it's really sounding like a picture of like community acquired pneumonia, so we'll do a couple of things for him. Uhm, we can get his temperature, get his oxygen oxygen saturation right away we'll get a chest x-ray. We'll do some blood work as well and uhm, he might need to be admitted depending on uhm, the oxygen, oxygen saturation and the fact that he's grunting. So if he's admitted will give him some extra oxygen and keep monitoring him and keep him hydrated. Uhm we'll also give him some antibiotics if, if it turns out he has pneumonia. Yeah, does that sound OK?"
8661,That sounds good. Thank you.,"OK yeah, no worries."
8662,So I've been having a lot of trouble in the last two weeks of especially this past week of just a lot of shortness of breath. I'm getting a lot of coughing as well and producing a lot of material. And also I think I might have been having a fever this week as well.,"OK, uh, the shortness of breath is it happening at rest or exertion and how much exertion?"
8663,"Uhm, I think it's happening mostly on exertion. Usually I'm able to walk around the house, no issues, go up and down stairs, but right now I'm pretty limited. I can't really go up and down stairs without getting really short of breath. I can't even walk from the bedroom to the kitchen without becoming shortness of, like short of breath.","OK, um OK, and when did that change happen?"
8664,So I would say one week ago is when this all kind of started.,"OK, and has it been getting any better, worse, or staying the same?"
8665,"I would say it's kind of getting worse. I'm coughing a lot more sputum up. I'm getting more and more short of breath. Now, I do have a call for like a very long time now I've I was diagnosed with COPD in my 60s. Probably like 10 years ago and but this seems to be just a much worse than my COPD.","OK, sure it's been a lot worse in the last week it sounds like. OK. Uhm have you, are you able to lie flat? Like on your back without experiencing shorter breath, shortness of breath?"
8666,"Yeah, and when I'm resting or lying down or trying to sleep I don't get short of breath.","OK, and have you ever had instances where you woke up in the middle of the night really short of breath and you had to sit up to catch your breath?"
8667,"Uh no, I don't think so.","OK, have you noticed any leg swelling?"
8668,No.,"OK, and you said that to you, so you've had a cough for awhile now, but it's gotten worse. This past week in your, are you bringing up sputum?"
8669,"Yeah, I'm bringing up a lot of materials. I think every time I cough I'm bringing some sputum up and right now the like usually the color is like clear to whitish but right now it's a bit more yellow.","OK, so a change in the sputum color and also sounds like you're bringing up more sputum as well."

8673,Yeah.,Yeah OK. And have you had any chest pain?
8674,"Just when I'm coughing and getting short of breath, I do have some discomfort in my chest.","OK, uh, do you feel that, or could you describe he the pains character? Like is it sharp, dull, or achy?"
8675,"It's more just an ache and it's kind of more of a discomfort than a pain, and it kind of goes away once my episode of coughing and shortness of breath is relieved with some rest.","OK. Uh, and uh, have you been experiencing any fevers or chills?"
8676,"Yeah, I've been noticing that I'm getting a lot more chills this past week. They kind of come and go, but even at night I get like these chills that after wrap myself up in at least three blankets.","OK, and have you had a fever?"
8677,"Uh, I didn't get a chance to measure any of them, but I might have had a fever just from the chills that I'm expecting that I had a fever.","OK, and have you had any night sweats?"

It is sounding like a COPD exacerbation with the increasing and the change changing sputum. The increasing frequency of cough and the exertional shortness of breath as well, along with wheezing and kind of this chest discomfort that you're experiencing. And so, uh, this will require some antibiotics as well and depending on the severity of symptoms, possibly some steroids as well to help with the inflammation."
8709,"Yes, I just came in here today. I I've just been. Really getting like the soreness in my throat for the past, I would say four days and I also had a fever for the last two days as well.","OK. So the sore throat, have you been having  pain with swallowing foods or liquids?"

Or that I maybe forgot to ask about?"
8758,No. I think that those are all the questions I had.,"OK, so with your current symptoms right now with no cough, tonsillar exudate, a fever, also your age and the like swelling and redness that you notice in the back of your throat is likely a group a strep pharyngitis that's causing this. And with your exposure to your brother who also received antibiotics, could be potentially be a sick contact for you that you were around, so this would require antibiotics as well for yourself and we'll do a rapid strep antigen test to check for this and wait on the result for that because it it still could possibly be a viral illness and so that passes negative and we're thinking it's a viral illness then we might hold off on antibiotics for now and monitor symptoms. And if at any point things get worse like you start to get shortness of breath or your fever's getting worse and it's not, not being controlled, then we'll reeassess the situation."

I'll have to look into her ear to see if I see any inflammation or perforation and then based on that we'll discuss some management. She may require some antibiotics like she has had before, but that will depend on what. I see on physical examination she has been having a fever so she might. And it's only been three days, right? So we may even do some conservative management and get her to take some maybe pain medications and then go from there. Or ear drops."
9052,OK.,"Uh, but yeah, so we'll do the examination and then go from there. She said she has, besides the fever and that your pain she's not really having any other symptoms so?

9166,"Uhm it's usually I feel like whatever I eat. Yeah, contents, food contents.","OK, do you think anything triggered that episode of vomiting?"

9168,"Uhm, no. Nothing like that.","OK, any constipation?"

9176,"No, nothing like that.",OK. Uhm and where do you currently live?
9177,"I live just in an apartment just in the city. So yeah, just by myself though.","OK, any like old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets, anything that could be triggering your symptoms?"
9178,"No, not really.",OK and have you been in contact with anyone sick recently?
9179,"No, I've been. And kind of. At home, the only places I maybe have been in contact with someone is maybe at work. In like the lunch room and things like that.","OK. OK and sorry, where do you work?"
9180,I work at a car dealership.,"OK, OK. An any travel recently?"
9181,No.,"OK, has anyone at your work been sick as well?"
9182,"No, I haven't really noticed anyone being sick.","OK, OK, well those were the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for me?"
9183,"No, I I was just wondering what this can be.","Um yeah, so the first thing we want to rule out as covid because a lot of your symptoms overlap with those of covid, so we'll take a swab and you should get those results in about 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days. And if your results are positive, public health will be in touch with you to do some contact tracing. But if it's not covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around this time of year that could be causing similar symptoms as well, but either way the management kind of is supportive, so making sure you're well hydrated, eating nutritious food, sleeping well, taking antipyretics like Tylenol for fever's if you get any. And you can also take Tylenol or anseads for muscle ache, joint pains, anything like that. Does that sound OK?"
9184,"Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.","OK. Great, no problem."
9185,"Hey I I came in here today I I just was feeling just a bit short of breath over the last few days and I've had a so I normally have a cough, but I've just been coughing a lot more over the last week and I don't know if it's if it's something else. I I do have a COPD diagnosis which I was diagnosed with like a couple years ago, but this is this seems to be much worse.","OK, you said you were diagnosed with COPD couple years ago. Was that two years ago? Three years ago?"
9186,"It was almost, probably five years ago.","Five years ago, OK, and have you always had this cough since then?"
9187,"Yeah Iâve probably had a cough for the last 10 years, I think.",OK.
9188,Yeah.,And you youâve mentioned that this cough has gotten worse over the last week?
9189,"Yeah, I've been coughing a lot more. Even just walking down the stairs from my bedroom to even the kitchen I just have to take a little bit of a breather, just start coughing.",OK. And is it a dry cough or are you bringing up any phlem?
9190,"No, I'm bringing up like this. It's usually before this week. It was like kind of a clear to yellow. Sorry clear to white material, but this past week it's been more yellow in color.","OK, any blood in there?"
9191,"No, I mean notice any blood.","OK and you said you were also short of breath, uhm when did that start?"
9192,"So that's just in the last few days. But just to clarify, I do get short of breath here and there sometimes I have to use puffers, but the last few days I've just been really short of breath, even even if I walk a little bit after like sit down and, can't really catch my breath.","OK. Alright, and do you get short of breath when you're laying down?"
9193,"Uhm no, not really, it's mainly just when I'm moving around and doing stuff.","OK, how about when you're asleep? Does it wake you up and kind of make you gasp for air?"
9194,No.,"No OK. So no orthopnea or PND. Alright, and the puffers that you're on, can you remind me which ones you're on again?"
9195,"So I'm on this one called Ventilin for the which Iâve been using a lot more recently just for relief and then, I'm on this other puffer thing. It's called spiriva.","OK, how often? How? How many times this week have you had to use your ventilin?"
9196,"Uhm, Ventilin are probably used. Probably almost like 10 times this past week.","OK. Alright, any chest pain?"
9197,"Uhm? Just when I'm having like those coughing fits in with the breathing, I feel some discomfort, but that's it.","OK, OK. Alright and then any palpitations or feeling like your heart's racing?"
9198,Uh no.,"OK. Alright, and do you ever feel like your calves hurt after you walk awhile?"
9199,"No, not really.","No OK, any dizziness or fainting spells?"
9200,"Uhm, No, no, not that I know.",OK. Numbness or tingling?
9201,No.,Confusion or memory loss?
9202,No.,Headaches?
9203,No.,Changes in your bowel movements?
9204,No.,Uhm nausea or vomiting?
9205,"Uh, no.",Changes in your appetite?
9206,"No, not really. Eating about the same.","OK, changes in your urine?"
9207,No.,Runny nose or stuffy nose?
9208,"Uh, no. I donât have that.","OK, sore throat?"
9209,No.,Any changes in your vision or hearing?
9210,No.,Changes in your smell or taste?
9211,"No, not really.","OK, how about weight loss?"
9212,"No, my weights been pretty steady.","OK, chills?"
9213,"Uhm, maybe a few times this, like from that last couple days I've been feeling a bit chilly. But I I don't know if I have a fever or anything like that.","OK, so you haven't actually measured your temperature right?"
9214,No.,"OK, we can do that today. Any rashes?"
9215,Uh no.,Fatigue?
9216,No.,"OK, um and besides the COPD do you have any other longstanding medical conditions?"
9217,Uhm. I I have a like high cholesterol.,OK.
9218,"And. Just I, I used to take blood pressure medications but I don't right now.","OK. And what kind of blood pressure medications did you use to take, and how come you stopped?"
9219,"I was on like a diuretic. Then the doctor said, like my blood pressure was really well under control, so I just stopped taking it.","OK, OK, and the doctor was OK with that."
9220,"Uh no, I just stopped taking it. I didn't really like ask the doctor.","OK, well, we'll keep checking your blood pressure and that's something you should keep an eye on as well, just in case ou have complications with your kidneys. Does that sound OK?"
9221,Yeah.,OK uhm? And are you on any medications other than the puffers?
9222,Just a Torva Staten.,"For your cholesterol OK, and are you up to date with your immunizations?"
9223,"Yeah, not even a vaccine.",Pardon me?
9224,I even got the coronavirus vaccine.,"OK, good Congrats. Did you also get the shingles vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine?"
9225,Yeah I got them.,"OK, OK good, any allergies?"
9226,"Uh, no, not that I know.",How about a family history of lung or heart conditions?
9227,"Uhm? My father had lung cancer but he smoked a lot, I also smoke so I sometimes worry about that, but he had cancer and my mother, she was perfectly healthy. Yeah, so just my father.",Just your father OK. How much do you smoke?
9228,"Probably half a pack a day. It used to be one pack, even 2 packs at one point in time, but right now it's half the packaging.","OK, alright, well, it's good that you're cutting down. And if you need more resources to help you do that, we have some available that we can refer you to. Do you take any other recreational drugs like cannabis, heroin, cocaine?"
9229,"No, nothing like that, no.",OK. And do you drink alcohol?
9230,Um just probably maybe like a couple times a month.,Couple times a month OK. And are you currently married?
9231,"Yeah, I currently live with my sorry, wife, in an apartment.","OK, and any reason for you to believe you have old carpets, mold, dust, asbestos, pets, anything that could be triggering your symptoms?"
9232,"No, nothing like that. We live in like a fairly new apartment.","OK, OK, good, and have you been in contact with any sick people recently?"
9233,"No, not not really. Wieâve been just to ourselves.","OK, and have you traveled anywhere recently?"
9234,"No, just been on our house.","OK. Alright, well those were all the questions that I had. Did you have any questions of your own?"
9235,"Uh, yeah I was just wondering what this can be.","Yeah, you know it sounds like you have a cough and shortness of breath, and both of these things you've had for a while, but now they're getting worse and based on your past history of COPD I would say this sounds like a COPD exacerbation. So for that we will start off with some basic blood work like CBC, electrolytes, your kidney function, ABGâs, as well as like a chest X Ray. And basically we should treat it we're going to take your oxygen saturation an give you some extra oxygen if you need. Weâll continue to use your bronchodilators an and in addition to both of that will also give you some steroids as well as antibiotics. And just to prevent any infections or if you already have it then it can help with that as well. And because your symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid will also do a covid swab just to make sure it's not that. And you should hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours. How does that sound?"
9236,That sounds good. Thank you.,"OK, yeah, no problem."
9237,"Thats great, thank you.",Awesome OK. It says here that you have been having a sore throat. Can you tell me a little bit more about that?
9238,"Sure, yeah the sore throat it started about four days ago. And it's really it's it's very sore. I can drink fluids OK but I'm even having some issues swallowing food.","OK, so you said four days ago?"
9239,"Yes, four days ago.","OK. So it's been kind of sore, some issues swallowing food OK, and over the last four days has it gotten worse, Better that it stayed the same?"
9240,"Um the sore throat has it's got, it's getting worse for sure.","OK, have you ever had anything like this before?"
9241,"I I, I guess when I was younger I had mono. And I had a sore throat when I had that, yeah.","OK, is there anything that makes it worse or like anything that makes it feel better right now?"
9242,"No, not really. I've tried, you know, I've tried gargling with salt water. I've tried some painkillers like nothing, nothing seems to be working.","Uhm OK, and you said you've also had some difficulty breathing."
9243,"Yeah, that's right.",Did that start around the same time?
9244,"That actually started yesterday, and it's gotten me very concerned.","OK. Yeah, I can understand how that would be concerning. We're definitely going to try to get to the bottom of it today. Um OK so started yesterday, said then has it gotten any worse? Is it the same way better?"
9245,"Um the, well, I guess it's getting worse, yeah.",Do you feel like it's all the time or is it on and off?
9246,It's it's just there all the time.,Have you ever had any difficulty breathing in the past?
9247,"Um no no, no, not like this.",OK. Uh. Have you have you recently been in contact with anyone that's been sick?
9248,"Um. I have, no. I don't leave the house much nowadays. I go to the grocery store, I go to the bank. Just essential things.","OK, have you traveled recently?"
9249,"Um no, no, I haven't left the city for anything.",OK. Do you know if your immunizations are up to date?
9250,"Ah yes, everything's up to date.",OK. Thatâs good. See you so I'm just gonna ask you about a few other symptoms. I just like to get an idea if there's anything else you been experiencing. Have you had a cough at all?
9251,No.,Have you had a runny nose?
9252,No runny nose.,Have you had any headaches?
9253,No.,Have you had any chest pain?
9254,"Ah nope, no chest pain.",Have you have you lost any of your sense of smell or taste?
9255,Um maybe taste a little bit but not smell.,"OK, OK, when did that start?"
9256,The taste ah. Maybe two days ago?,OK. OK taste two days ago. Has it been on and off or has it been kind of constantly like a reduced sense of taste?
9257,It's it's. It's been pretty constant.,OK. Have you had anything like that before?
9258,No.,Have you had any fevers?
9259,I don't think so.,OK. Have you had any chills or night sweats?
9260,No.,Have you felt overall really tired and weak?
9261,"I. I felt tired, maybe not weak, but my I feel like my muscles all ache.","OK. OK, and when did that start?"
9262,That started. Like immediately after my sore throat.,"OK. OK. OK, well we might circle back. I think there is any more questions you want to ask. Right now, but just in general, in terms of your overall health, do you have any chronic conditions that you take medications for or see a doctor for regularly?"
9263,Um I have mild COPD.,OK. And what medications are you currently taking?
9264,Um I'm on a long acting beta agonist.,"OK, is that the only medication you take?"
9265,Pardon me.,Is that the only medication that you take?
9266,And I also take a couple of vitamins.,OK. Do you have any allergies?
9267,"Um no, no allergies.",Just gonna ask you few questions about your lifestyle. Do you live here in town?
9268,I do.,Do you ah live alone or with family?
9269,I live alone.,OK. And do you smoke?
9270,I quit two years ago.,"Oh congratulations, before that did you did you smoke for many years?"
9271,"I did, I smoked for 40 years.",OK. Do you drink alcohol?
9272,"I drink occasionally, maybe like on the weekends.","OK. Uhm, and do you use cannabis?"
9273,No.,OK any other drugs?
9274,"No, no other drugs.",OK. And are you retired? Do you work?
9275,"I am retired, yeah.","OK, what did you do for work before?"
9276,I worked for GM.,"Crock. OK. And do you have any family history of respiratory problems, heart problems and?"
9277,No.,"OK. Uhm. OK, I think that that about covers my questions for you right now. Is there anything else that you wanted to add that I didn't ask you about?"
9278,"Um no, I don't think so.","OK. Iâm going to go over this with the document I'm working with today, I'm guessing just because some of your symptoms are in line with common symptoms of covid 19, that will probably do a covid swab, and what happens with that is since we do have some syptoms, will have to isolate until the result come back and potentially after that if you still have symptoms, even if it is negative. So that's just kind of a heads up on that. Maybe one of the next things that happens. We will probably get you a chest xray 'cause we want to get an idea of what's going on in there. Did you have any other questions?"
9279,"No, thank you very much.",OK well thanks for chatting with me we should be back shortly to kind of let you know with the next step.
9280,"OK, great, thank you.",Thanks.
9281,"Hi. So I just brought in my son he's 5. Essentially, when he, so today is Friday when he got home from school on Wednesday, he seemed fine, but he I donât know that night he started to have a bit of like a cough. It just seemed like a little dry cough, but obviously I just wanted to keep him home, keep him safe and not like spread anything if he was sick. So he stayed at home on Thursday and he was like having a bit of a cough. Then yesterday it seemed to get a little bit worse and he was really tired, uh sorry. Today, today is Friday. He was like his cough is like getting a bit worse and I've been taking his temp the whole time and it got like a little high today, what was it? My thermometer says it was high. I'm just like trying to remember it was it was. It was like over 100 though.",Oh OK.
9282,"Uh, 101 or something or maybe 100.1 if. But anyways it was so I I just thought I should probably bring him in 'cause I was really worried about him and you know so he could have maybe got covid and like at school or something.","Yeah for sure. Um OK, so just to clarify, he's had this cough and fever for the past five five days."
9283,Mhm.,"OK, OK so let's focus on the cough."
9284,"Itâs Friday. Its been more like like 3 days.  Wednesday is when he came home, and then um he. And then today is Friday. So yeah, sorry.","Today is Friday OK. And um. OK, yeah sure uh so. Is this cough a productive cough, or is it kind of a dry cough?"
9285,"Uh I think it's dry. I haven't noticed him like spitting up anything. Yeah he yeah, its just like little cough.","OK, And. He is he. He's not bringing up any sputum or blood?"
9286,No.,"No OK good. OK, and does he sound wheezy at all to you?"
9287,"No, no, not that I've noticed.","OK, how about short of breath?"
9288,"Um I don't think so like he usually he's a really active kid and he has. He hasn't been running a lot outside in the past couple of days, so maybe he maybe he could have been having a harder time breathing. But also I think he's just been tired in general.","OK, yeah. OK, Uhm. Is his coughing getting worse with certain times of the day? Like is it worse at night, in the morning?"
9289,Mm I think it kinda just there the whole day.,"OK, and it does it, how does it sound? Does this sound like a barky cough? Does it sound? Uhm? Like harsh, what is what would you say the quality of it, of the sound of the cough is?"
9290,"Uh, I, just sounds kind of dry. It's not like super loud.","OK. OK, and has he ever experienced anything like this in the past?"
9291,"Um like he's had colds before, but I haven't like. I haven't like you this time he kind of had the fever, which is different than you know, having a regular cold.",OK. And are his symptoms getting worse?
9292,"I think so 'cause yeah, the first day he just seemed like a little dry and then yesterday is coughing and today he actually has a fever.","OK, and is he complaining of anything like chest pain? Or feeling like his heart's racing?"
9293,"No, I don't think so.","No, OK. Does he have a sore throat?"
9294,Mm I don't think so.,"OK, and is he having any issues swallowing food or fluids?"
9295,"I don't know if he's having trouble swallowing, but he doesn't seem to have a big appetite right now.","OK, and is he, does he have a blocked nose or runny nose?"
9296,Maybe a bit of like a look at runny nose.,"OK, and does he have any issues with smell or taste?"
9297,"He, this morning he really seemed like he wasn't like into his breakfast and I wonder if he's losing his sense of taste a little bit.","OK, how about vision or hearing?"
9298,I think those are fine.,"OK, and is he complaining of any chills or night sweats?"
9299,No.,"OK, any changes in his hair, nails or skin like rashes?"
9300,"No, I haven't noticed anything like that.",Any changes in his bowel movements. Pardon?
9301,Um sorry no changes.,"OK, no diarrhea, no constipation, no blood in the stool?"
9302,No,"OK, any nausea or vomiting?"
9303,No.,"OK, any changes in his urine?"
9304,"I havenât really been looking, but I don't think so.",Any dizziness or fainting spells?
9305,"No, just like fatigue.","OK, any confusion or memory loss?"
9306,No.,And is he and is he an otherwise healthy child?
9307,"Yeah, actually he hasn't decided to like a vaccine that he hasn't had to go to the doctor like ever like. I mean, he broke his arm once, but that was it.","OK, um so no past illnesses and I guess no hospitalizations or surgeries except for the broken arm."
9308,"Exactly, like nothing.","OK, and were things normal with your pregnancy with him?"
9309,Yeah totally.,"OK um. And then how about as a newborn, any complications after birth?"
9310,"No, no, like everything is things really good.","OK, and then did he hit all his milestones up till now?"
9311,Yeah totally.,"OK. Any, does he have any allergies?"
9312,"Um. No, no, I don't think so. I mean like he hasn't really taken a lot of medicine, so it's hard to say, but like nothing.",Is he up to date with all his immunizations?
9313,Yeah.,"Yeah OK. And. In terms of family history, are there any lung conditions or heart conditions?"
9314,Uh no everyone is really healthy.,"OK, and. And are there and who does he live with and where does he live?"
9315,"Um he lives with just me and my husband, and he has a little sister, like this in town here.","OK and, is she healthy?"
9316,"Yeah, I think she, yeah she's healthy.","OK um? Any concerns for old carpets, mold, asbestos or any environmental issues like that in the home that you're in?"
9317,No.,"No, OK. Has he been around any sick contacts recently?"
9318,"Not, not like outside of school. I like we know for sure, not outside of school, um but he goes to school right now so. Kinda hard to say.",OK.
9319,But they haven't. They haven't like contacted us about anything.,"OK, sure. And has he traveled anywhere recently?"
9320,No.,"No OK. OK, well those are all the questions I had for you today. Were, was there anything that I missed that you wanted to chat about today?"
9321,"I don't think so. Um, like I, I realized that I can often times like you don't really do much for kids when you know when it's just like a virus or something. But we do, I guess need to have a covid test to go back to the school, even if you know either way 'cause they want us to be able to say. It's like the other kids have had an exposure.",Yeah for
9322,"yeah, like. Sorry, go ahead,",No go ahead.
9323,Iâm just basically wanted to see if it was bad. I mean he doesn't receive your so scared. That's kind of what makes him in like it's gonna be a little bit.,"Right, yeah, OK, so first thing is, first we need to do a covid swab just to make sure that he either has it or it doesn't have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Um we do suggest because his symptoms are allowed with symptoms of covid that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister possible. And then if the swab comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays, and if his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms, like seizures or. If he's feeling weak, dizzy if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and. And so for now I'll just wait for those covid swaps to come back. How does that sound?"
9324,"Yeah, sounds good.","OK great yeah, yeah no worries and. I I should have mentioned if it was just the cough or if he was just short of breath or something like that and he didn't have the fever, we would add other things like asthma to the list of things he could be worked up for, but um right now it sounds like it sounds like an infection."
9325,"OK yeah, that's good to know.","Alright, sounds great. Have a good day."
9326,"Yeah, so for the past two days I I've I've noticed that I can't smell things as well, as I used to be able to smell them and I seem to have lost my sense of taste as well. And I have this mild dry cough. I'm just worried it's covid.",OK. You said for a couple days?
9327,"Yes, for two days.","OK, have you ever had anything like this before?"
9328,"No, no, nothing like this.","OK, when you say you feel like you've lost sense of taste and smell, is it totally gone or do you taste a little bit? Or how? How is that working for you?"
9329,"The smell isn't totally gone I can still smell something if it smells really really bad and and then and then I can taste really, really salty foods, but I can taste normal things like I can't taste of banana.","OK, is that been pretty consistent throughout the last couple of days or is it on and off?"
9330,"It's been pretty consistent, yeah.",OK. And did this dry cough that start at the same time?
9331,Yes.,"And when you say sorry, you said mild cough, and I my next question was do you feel like it's a dry cough or you producing any sputum? Any blood? Or is it to not, not bringing up anything?"
9332,It's dry.,"OK, has that gotten worse over the last couple of days?"
9333,The dry cough? Um it's been pretty consistent as well.,"OK is there, have you done anything to try to make it better? Have you taken any over the counter medications or?"
9334,"No, I haven't tried anything.","OK, OK. Have you had, in addition to these symptoms, have you had any fevers?"
9335,"Fevers, no fevers.","OK, any difficulty breathing?"
9336,No.,"OK, any headaches?"
9337,"Um no, no headaches.","OK, any sore throat?"
9338,No.,"OK, any chills or night sweats?"
9339,No.,"OK, any muscle ache or general weakness?"
9340,Uh no.,"OK, so generally it seems like you're pretty well other than this loss of taste slash smell and the dry cough that correct,"
9341,Yes.,OK and then recently have you been in contact with anyone that's been sick?
9342,"Um no not that I can remember or yeah, not that I can remember.","OK, have you traveled anywhere?"
9343,"Um I went hiking with my partner two weeks ago. I guess there were some people who kind of brushed by us, but other than that I don't see where else I could have gotten this from.","OK, was that hiking somewhere close by?"
9344,"Yeah, it was like half an hour from where we are.",OK. Are your immunizations up to date?
9345,Yes.,"OK, and can you think of any for this dry cough, just a circle back to that. Can you think of anything that triggers it? It's called the cold or being around certain things like cats or dogs or any other environmental things?"

9363,No.,"OK. OK. Uhm I think that's all my questions for now. Uh I definitely like to get you a covid test just because your symptoms are consistent with some common covid symptoms. So basically that means that we would do a swab. It might not come back for a day or two. You definitely have to self isolate between now and when you get the results back, potentially even if it's negative, longer, if you're still having symptoms."
9364,Yeah.,"Otherwise, there probably. There might be a couple other tests we want to do. We might have more questions when we come back, we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today, but just wanted to give you a heads up of what to expect next. Did you have anything else you wanted to tell me that I didn't ask you about or any questions?"
9365,"No, uh thank you so much.","OK, well thanks for coming in today. Will definitely get you taken care of shortly."

9367,"Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.",Can you tell me about what brought you in today?

9369,I am.,"Hi mum. Um OK. You got a cough you said I'm sorry, you said for five days?"
9370,"For, yeah, four to five days ish, yeah?","OK. And, uh, has it you said it was a dry cough? Is that right?"
9371,"Yeah, that's right.","OK, so at no point were you bringing up on gunk with your cough?"
9372,"Yeah. No, no, nothing like that.","OK. Since it started, do you think it's gotten worse or has it kind of stayed the same? Gotten any better?"
9373,It's kind of stayed the same.,"OK. OK, uhm. Along with the cough have have you been having any other new symptoms?"

9378,It's pretty clear.,"OK, OK. Uhm. And uh have you had any fevers? Your mom might be able to answer that one better."
9379,"Yeah, um. He has had uh like he's had fevers in the past, but I I didn't really check this time. He didn't seem hot. He didn't have any chills.","OK, well that's good. Uhm. OK, have you had any back or muscle pain?"

9387,Iâm going to school and they're doing these half days.,"OK. OK uhm, and has anyone in your school been sick?"
9388,"Ah, Nope, not recently.",At least not that we know of. OK.
9389,No.,"OK, have you ever had anything like this before?"
9390,"No. I've been pretty healthy otherwise. I've never had like I've never had like a dry cough like this. I've had runny nose in the past, but they never lasted this long.","OK, have you ever been in the hospital?"
9391,No.,OK. Did you see your family doctor for anything? Any health problems?
9392,"No, no.",Do you take any medicines?

9402,I am playing Rollercoaster Tycoon.,"Oh cool, that sounds like fun. OK well, hopefully we can get you back to feeling healthy so you can continue to play lots of roller coaster Tycoon. So Iâm going to go get the doctor that I'm working with. I'm, uh, I'm wondering, you know, he might want to do a chest X Ray and get a better look at what's going on there. Have you ever had an X Ray before?"
9403,"I don't think so, no.",Do you know what an X Ray is?
9404,"A little bit, yeah.","Yeah it's like taking picture of your body on the inside. It's pretty cool so it gives us an idea of what's going on in the inside. Also, this really this part is kind of not so much fun, but I think we should probably do a covid swab because we're doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately and that's not a lot of fun. We gotta stick something up your nose, but I think that you're really brave and I think that you'll be just fine with it, OK?"
9405,OK.,So we're going to arrange for these things and then I will come back with the doctor that I'm working with and we'll kind of talk about where to go from here.
9406,"OK, that sounds good.",Thank you guys for chatting with me.
9407,"Yeah, thank you.",Thanks.
9408,Yeah.,I know that you've been having experiencing a cough. Can you tell me a little bit about that?
9409,"Yeah, I um I've had this cough for the past two weeks and it just doesn't go.",OK. have never had anything like this before?
9410,"Iâm I usually get a cold once a year or so. But the cough doesn't last this long, like it's usually over in a week or week and a half or so.",Mm. And it's it's not letting up.
9411,Mm.,OK um. I'm gonna ask you a few questions about the cough itself. Is this a dry cough that you're experiencing? Or are you producing like any any mucus or coughing up anything?
9412,"There was some mucus um earlier on, but now it's it's all, itâs a dry cough.","Now, it's dry OK how long, what was the timeline for that? I guess how long?"
9413,"Yeah, so maybe for the first four or five days there was this like whitish clear kind of mucus that was coming up and then after that was a a dry cough.","OK, OK. And do you feel like the intensity of the cough got worse over the last two weeks, or has it gotten any better?"
9414,"Kind of the same, I would say.",And has the cough gotten more frequent over this time as well?
9415,No.,How often would you say that you're coughing?
9416,"Uhm? It's hard for me to quantify, maybe a couple of times an hour, maybe three or four times an hour or so.","Is there anything you can think of that triggers the cough, or is it spontaneous?"
9417,"Itâs kinda, spontaneous um. Can't really think of anything.","OK. And along with the cough, are you experiencing any difficulty breathing?"
9418,No.,"OK, have you noticed any fevers?"
9419,"Uhm, no.",OK um. Have you had any sore throat?
9420,Um I did initially um for the first two or three days and then that got better.,OK um. Have you had any runny nose?
9421,"I did initially yeah, I have like had all those flu symptoms for the first couple of days, but the cough just kinda stayed. Everything else resolved in the first uhm three or four days I would say.","OK. Thank you for sharing that have you had, did you have any chest pain at any point?"
9422,"No, but I guess like sometimes when I'm coughing too much my chest hurts a little bit.","OK, so it feels kind of sore after all that?"
9423,Yeah.,"OK. OK, have you been in contact, I guess it's hard to say because it started a while ago, but before it started bringing contact with anyone that's been sick?"
9424,"I I work at the hospital, but. Um I'm wearing PPE all the time, and I'm very careful so.",OK. Have you traveled anywhere outside of the province?
9425,No.,"OK, have you had any nausea or vomiting?"
9426,No.,"OK, any belly pain?"
9427,"Uhm, no.","OK, um so I'm just gonna ask you some questions about your overall health. Have you had any respiratory problems in the past?"
9428,No.,OK. Or do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for regular thing?
9429,"Iâve got acid reflux and uh, I also have anxiety.",Are you currently taking any medications?
9430,"Um. I I used to, not anymore.","Uh, was there any particular medication that you stopped recently?"
9431,"No, no. I used to take. I used to take something for anxiety two three years ago.",OK. And what do you do for your reflux?

9441,Iâm a clerk at the hospital.,"OK. Right, you just say you working at the hospital. And, uh. I can't think I thought I had another question for you, but I can't remember it. Anything else that you wanted to tell me about that I didn't ask you."
9442,"Um. No, I guess I was just wondering why I still have a cough. It's been such a long time. Um yeah, and I was wondering if I could get any medications just to help with that. It's not really. Yeah, it's everyone's like scared at work when I cough. I have. I have had the covid test and I don't have it, um so yeah.",When we got the last test done?
9443,"Um I had the test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago? Since then I've been at home and I'm just waiting for my symptoms to get better, but I you know, I kind of like get back, and I don't want to be coughing when I get back. Um yeah.","OK. Well, I'm gonna have a quick listen to your heart and lungs I'll do a quick physical exam and then I will go get the doctor that I'm working with all kind of go over everything you talked about, and then we'll come back and talk to you about where to go from here."
9444,Sounds great.,OK well thanks for chatting with me.
9445,"So I so I have COPD and it's usually like pretty manageable with my puffers and that. But just in the last like 3 days I feel like it's gotten a lot worse. You know, I, I feel like I'm coughing more often and I'm now, uh, kind of producing more sputum. Kind of like a green yellowy sputum uhm. I even notice that there is like a little bit of blood a couple times when I was like, really coughing hard. Iâve been finding it like harder to breathe than usual. I donât have home oxygen or anything, and I'm not. I didn't think I was quite there yet, but this these last few days it's been. It's been really hard to breathe.","I see OK, so this is happened in the past three days. Have your symptoms gotten better or worse over this time?"
9446,"I feel like they've been get maybe maybe getting a little worse. They definitely haven't gotten better,","OK, and has this ever happened to you before?"
9447,"Iâve had I had some troubles like when I've been sick before where the cough is gotten pretty bad. This is probably this is probably the worst that I've had, but I have like I have had in my COPD been made worse by being sick.","I see OK. Well, I guess the first thing we're going. So how's tbad, how bad is your shortness of breath?"
9448,"Like I I walked here fine, but I normally like can walk around the block and I go for a walk, usually a couple times a day to walk my dog and it's been just it's been a little bit trickier to do that.",I see OK. And uh have you ever had any hospitalizations in the past specifically for COPD exacerbations?
9449,"Um I haven't. Uhm, like stayed over in the hospital. I like come to emerge a couple times.",Alright um. How many times?
9450,I think twice maybe over the last like three years.,Uhm when were you diagnosed with COPD?

9455,Here by the bed. I would say had a fever.,Sure. And. Have you had any other symptoms? So have you had like a runny nose or stuffy nose? Any pain in your sinus?
9456,"I think I think I have a I've had a bit of a like this pressure in the sinus area, but it's been the cough has been the thing that's been the most bothersome.",I see and have you had a sore throat at all?

9463,"Uh, no, nothing like that.",Alright. And have you had any exposures to anyone who could potentially be sick?
9464,"Um. Let me think I I meet my I meet a couple of friends to walk our dogs together outside and one of them was a bit sick for a bit. We try not to get too close, but maybe I don't know. Maybe sometimes we walk a little too close. We feel too safe 'cause we're like outside.","OK, OK um. And did your friend get a covid test done?"
9465,Uhm? I donât know.,"That's OK. OK, and you mentioned that you had COPD that was diagnosed four or five years ago. Any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?"
9466,Um. Yeah I have a high blood pressure.,"OK, and are you taking any medications?"
9467,"Iâm not, I'm not I we talked about it, but I decided to try to change my lifestyle as much as I could 1st and I've also done that for the COPD. It's generally pretty like I've been really trying to take care of it, but um I feel like I maybe got sick or something this time, yeah, so my blood pressure is like OK right now.","OK, OK."
9468,My pressure and then I lost weight and started this walking more.,"That's great. That's really, really good that you're taking better care of yourself. Should definitely continue doing that."
9469,Right?,And you've mentioned that you have some puffers. How often do you use those?
9470,"Oh like I have the one that I use every day. That I'm supposed to just use no matter what, and then the one that I use when kind of just when I need it. I probably use it like once every two weeks.","OK. OK. Uhm? And you mentioned that your COPDâs are getting better. Do you find that it's affecting your life in any way affecting the way that you're doing your daily activities at at home or at work, if you are working?"
9471,"I like pretty OK except for like if I get sick I so yeah, it's been.",I see.
9472,So I think it's like pretty well managed like I stay on top of my lifestyle now.,"Thats good, thats good. Do you have any allergies?"
9473,"Uh, no, no.","No, no allergies to medications ?"
9474,No.,"OK, OK, good and. Do you, just a couple more to general questions. Have you traveled anywhere outside the province recently?"
9475,No.,"You, I guess I should have asked you earlier, but have you noticed any change in your sense of smell?"
9476,"Uh no, I don't think so.",Any change in your sense of taste?
9477,"Uhm? No, I don't think so.",Any confusion or fuzzy feeling?
9478,Nope.,"No OK, any muscle aches in your body?"
9479,Uh no.,"OK, alright, and just kind of some questions about your living situation. Do you currently live alone? And I you mentioned that you have a dog? Are there any is there anybody, anyone else in the house?"
9480,Uh my husband.,OK and. Do you currently work?
9481,"Yeah, I uh, like I've been working from home. I worked for the municipality.",I see. Do you think you might have had any exposures to say dust or smoke or anything like that that could have worsened your symptoms?

9484,I used to. I quit once they said I have COPD. I smoked 1/2 pack a day for probably 20 years.,"OK, OK, and do you consume marijuana or any recreational drugs?"
9485,No.,"OK, uh, alright, well I guess one more question, are there any lung diseases or heart conditions or cancers that run in the family?"
9486,"No, nothing that I can think of.","Alright, well that's those are all the questions I had for you. I will now do it physical exam and look at your vitals and listen to your chest. It's likely that what you have right now is COPD exacerbation, maybe just a like an infection that you got, which worsened some of your COPD symptoms. We would also have to rule out covid, so we'll be doing a covid swab and will decide based on the on your labs in your vital signs. It's instead of other things whether you need to stay in the ER and be admitted, or if you are good to go home, I will also talk to my attending and will make those decisions together and come back and talk to you. Does that sound good to you?"
9487,"Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.",Your welcome.
9488,"Yeah, I woke up this morning and I was just feeling suddenly feeling very short of breath and I just wasn't sure what was going on, so I thought I would come in.","OK, this this morning suddenly feeling short of breath. OK, and this cough was not also something that happens suddenly this morning?"
9489,Yeah.,"OK, have you ever had anything like this before?"
9490,"Um no not I mean if I I get a call from time to time when I get sick, but I've never really felt short of breath.","OK, is this cough a dry cough or are you bringing up any sputum?"
9491,Um it's a dry cough.,"OK. OK, have you had any fevers?"
9492,"Um yeah, I checked it this morning. I was like it was kind of mild, so 37.4 I think.",OK. That was just this morning?
9493,Yeah.,"OK. OK, uh. Have you had any chest pain?"
9494,No.,OK Um. Have you felt at all like you're going to faint?
9495,"No, no. Although I I should let you know and maybe I don't know if it's related um, but I had a seizure last night. And, I was fine after and then I went to bed. Um I don't know if that's related, but I thought I should let you know. I do have a seizure disorder I have epilepsy.","OK OK, thank you for sharing that with me. Have you ever had any issues like this following seizures in the past?"
9496,"No, I usually don't get seizures very often. Um I kind of forgot to take my med. I think that might have yeah.","Alright, OK. No worries um. OK, is there anything, in terms of this shortness of breath and this cough, is there anything that makes it feel worse?"
9497,Um I.,In any position?
9498,"Yeah, I. I mean, I haven't really been in a lot of positions like it, just started three hours ago or so, so I haven't really.",That's a hard question.

9506,"No, I haven't.",Have you had any sore throat?
9507,No.,Runny nose?

9510,Um I'm taking Keppra.,"OK. And normally, are you having any difficulty remembering taking it, or was it just kind of a brain fart?"
9511,"No, it just kind of happened, it was, it was my daughter's birthday and we kind of just, I usually sort of have it with dinner time, but we did things a little bit differently and had like a celebration earlier on and so I completely forgot because I didn't have dinner later.","Oh yeah, that makes sense. It happens for sure. K, do you have any allergies?"
9512,No.,"Do you have any family history, any any diseases that run in your family?"

I'm going to go over it with the doctor was working today and now we'll come back shortly and talk to you about the next steps if there's any tests we want to do or how we want to move forward with this so."
9524,"Yeah, thats great.",OK. Sure see you shortly.

9545,Um not any one spot.,Any numbness or tingling in your arms or legs?
9546,"Uh, no.","OK. All right, have you had any exposure to anyone who could potentially be sick?"
9547,"Well. My grandkids, uh, visited last weekend and my grandson has a cold. He goes to daycare. Yeah, so I'm not really. I'm not really sure like he's been staying home and they didn't. They didn't really know that when they came to visit.","OK, that's yeah, uhm OK. And have you traveled anywhere outside the province?"
9548,No no.,OK alright. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
9549,"Uhm? I'm pretty, I'm pretty healthy. I have some um like reflux that I see my doctor for. And I've had I've had some difficulties like with like urinating a little bit. Yeah, my my prostate's a little big like it's not cancer but. So just those two things that aren't that aren't there that really big deal they don't affect my life too much.",Are you taking any medications for either problem?
9550,I take avodart.,OK.
9551,"And for the the reflux I take a tums here and there I used to be on a medication, but it seemed like I kind of figured out the foods that were going to help, so I stopped.","Great, that's great. Any allergies to medications, foods, or environmental allergies?"
9552,"Uh no, no","No, and any medical conditions that run in the family? Specifically, anything related to the lungs?"
9553,"No, not that I can think of.",And do you you mentioned that your grandkids have came to visit. Do you live alone?
9554,Uh no. I live with my wife.,And are you currently working or are you staying at home?
9555,"Uh, I'm working from home. I I, I've gone out a few times to see clients. I work as a financial advisor. I've gone to see a couple clients that are really old and have a hard time doing stuff over the phone or over the computer, but I'm like 95% from home.",Have you gone to see any clients in the past three or four days or in the past week?
9556,"No, no, it's probably been a couple weeks since I saw anyone .",Sure OK. And do you smoke? Or did you ever smoke at the past?
9557,"No, I I maybe did for maybe like three years in my 20s. It wasnât heavily yes.",Any marijuana or recreational drugs?
9558,No.,Any alcohol?
9559,I usually have a whiskey or two on the weekends.,"OK alright. Uh so it sounds like you have some sort of an infection with the fevers and fatigue and muscle aches, and then the difficulty breathing, of course, and then your sensation, that sensation that you are having a very cool sort of a sore throat and cough that you might be getting. We can't necessarily rule out covid just yet."
9560,Thats what I was worried about.,"Yeah, and given that you're having difficulties breathing, we're also going to have a look at your chest and do it physical exam, but also do a chest X Ray just to make sure, or just to see if there's anything a infection that is settling in your chest, and a covid swab and then uh go from there. Weâll decide whether you need to stay in the, you need to stay in the hospital and if you can go home based on those results, but if you are to go home, we would request that you stay away from from everyone, so including your wife. Try to self isolate as much as possible and your results should come out in 24 to 48 hours and then the public health nurse should tell you what to do if your results are positive."
9561,"OK, OK no, that sounds fair,","All right. Well, let's do a physical exam and then go from there."
9562,OK. Thank you.,You're welcome.
9563,"OK, I'm so I have been coughing a lot over the past week or so. And it's been pretty dry, but I've been coughing like almost nonstop throughout the day, and I'm feeling very short of breath, and my bronchodilator helps, but I found I'm using it a lot now.","OK, how long have you know that you have asthma for?"
9564,I was diagnosed when I was eight.,You're 10 now.
9565,That's right.,"So you're using your bronchodilator more. This is the one that you use, kind of as needed?"
9566,Yeah.,OK and then do you have one that you take every day no matter what?
9567,"Uhm? No, I don't have that one.",OK. You just have the one that you take is needed. Do you take any other medications?
9568,Uh no I don't take anything else.,Just the one is it a it's a puffer?
9569,Yes.,"OK, and you're using it more than normal, so how often were you normally using it?"
9570,Um I was only using it like I don't know. Maybe once every two weeks or so. Not very often. But now I'm using it like almost everyday like five six times a week.,"OK, any are you? Does it usually turned out that you need it like during certain times like say when you're exercising or when it's cold?"
9571,"Um I find I use it more, both like when it when it's right after I like, run around after gym during recess. Um and yeah, the cold also makes it worse.","OK, any other triggers that you can think of?"
9572,"No, no other triggers.",Normally get more in certain seasons?
9573,"I. I guess no, no big changes there. I find the cold air makes it worse like winter makes it worse or like. Yeah, maybe also the spring spring with like pollen and stuff like that.","OK, so you have allergies too?"
9574,"I think, so I haven't ever been like formally diagnosed.","OK, I see I see. Yeah, that would make sense. No. OK, uh, so you say you've had more coughing lately, is that right? You said the last two weeks."
9575,Last two weeks.,Last two weeks. Is your cough and a dry cough?
9576,Yeah.,Have you been bringing up gunk OK. Dry cough? Have you noticed any wheezing?
9577,"Oh yeah, I've been wheezing a lot, actually.","OK, uh and that's uh. Do you use your bronchodilator every time that you're wheezing?"
9578,"When it gets really bad, like when I get so easy that I find it hard to breathe.","OK, so you're getting Wheezy even more times than then you're having to use your bronchodilator."
9579,"Yes, that's right.",OK. Are you having any symptoms at night time?
9580,"Yeah, how they don't happen as much as my daytime symptoms, but I been having it maybe like every other day or like you know, every two days or so.","OK. And when you have these so when you have these episodes, you're copping your wheezy. Do you feel like you're having a hard time breathing?"
9581,"Yep, that's right.",Do you feel it gets tight in your chest?
9582,Yes.,"OK. OK, have you had any any colds lately? Or any infections? ."
9583,"Um no, no, nothing like that.","K, does anyone that lives with you or anyone that you're around often, has anyone been sick?"
9584,No.,OK. Could you have been in contact with anyone that sick even outside of your house?
9585,No.,"OK, have you traveled anywhere?"
9586,Uh no.,Have you lost any of your sense of taste or smell?
9587,No.,Have you had any fevers?
9588,Uh no.,OK. Any any? Nausea or vomiting?
9589,No.,Any belly pain?
9590,No.,"We just ask those questions because sometimes these things can happen with an infection or after an infection and we just want to make sure that that's not, you know what's happening right now. We probably will do a covid swab just because of the times that we're living in right now, but I just want to ask you a few more questions before I go talk to the doctor. So do you have besides your asthma, do you have any health problems?"
9591,"Oh no, no no.","OK. And you said, besides the bronchodilator, you're not taking any medications."
9592,No.,And you think you might have allergies in the spring? Do you have allergies to anything else that you know?
9593,"Uh no, not that I know of.","OK, does anyone else in your family have asthma?"
9594,I think my sister has asthma too.,Anyone in your family have any other breathing problems?
9595,No.,Anyone else in the family have any allergies?
9596,"Uh no, I don't think so.","OK. OK, sounds good and you live at home did you say live with your parents and your sister?"
9597,"Yep, that's right.",Cool. Are you currently going to school online or in person?
9598,Uh both We do half days.,OK. How are you finding that?
9599,"Yeah, it's been OK. It's it's different, but it's been working out OK so far.",Cool not to have to get out of your PJS some days.
9600,"Yes, that's true.","OK, did do you guys have any pets in the home?"
9601,"No pets, we have just like well I guess we have goldfish.","Oh, OK. Those are cool pets. Does anyone in the house smoke?"
9602,No.,"OK. OK, I think that's all my questions that I had for you today. What do you like to do for fun?"
9603,Oh I'm I like playing games online with my friends and and before covid we used to get together and have movie nights and play sports together.,"It sounds really cool. Hopefully we can get this figured out for you so you don't have any, you don't have to use your your medications every time you play sports 'cause that's no fun. And"
9604,No.,"You should be able to enjoy that. So, so we're going to try to get this sorted out for you. I'm gonna go talk to the doctor and tell him everything or her everything that you said and yeah weâll come back and see you shortly, hopefully maybe all you need is a little change to your medications and maybe it will be better be able to better control your asthma."
9605,"Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.",Thanks talking with me and we'll see you soon.
9606,"Yeah, I've noticed I've had this pretty bad cough for like the last couple of days. A little bit worried. Wanna talk to someone.","OK, so started two days ago."
9607,"No about what day is it today? Today is Wednesday. It started on Sunday, Sunday. I noticed it getting really bad.","OK, so it got really bad. Then it was it was it still present but not as bad before that?"
9608,Yeah I think I had like a bit of like a raspy cough on like Friday but Sunday it was when I started getting nervous about it.,"OK so almost a week, it sounds like. And what exactly changed on Sunday that you made it worse in your opinion?"
9609,So Sunday I started bringing I noticed like little spots of red kind of the the gunk I was bringing up.,OK.
9610,"And I kind of ignored it, but the next day they were still there. I started getting fever just in I felt off, you know.","OK. OK, so that you first notice that on Sunday, were you bringing up sputum before that and it just didn't have these spots or did it, did that part just start on Sunday?"
9611,"Sputum is kind of like the gunk up and bring it up? Yeah, it was. It's like this yellow custard, itâs got like well spots are red on it on Sunday.","OK, and before that did you have like the yellow custard without red? Or it all started at once all kind of started?"
9612,It all started at once to be honest.,"Sorry, I know these are tricky questions, and you said that you've had some fevers. Can you tell me a little bit about that? When did that start?"
9613,"So that started, the Monday really is when I first started. I never took my temperature. I just felt hot. You know that's been going on pretty much until today.","OK, did you ever feel like you were really shaky?"
9614,"Yeah, I've been getting the chills, especially last two days.","OK. So over this time you've had this cough, have you felt like you've had difficulty breathing?"
9615,"Not really, I feel a little bit winded doing things. I used to do like I take the stairs up to my apartment, but I have just happened really trying to exert myself that's been taking it easy so I haven't really noticed being out of breath.","OK, so probably if you were to get up and do a lot of physical activity you would feel worse."
9616,"Yeah, I could, probably I can still take the two stairs up to my apartment, but after that I started to feel pretty crummy.",OK. Is there anything else that you can think of that makes it feel worse?
9617,No.,Has anything helped it to feel better at all?
9618,Bringing up gunk makes it feel better for a little while.,So you kind of just clear it up and that feels a little bit better?
9619,"Yeah, I haven't taken some Tylenol at home and that helps a little bit.","OK, have you felt a sore throat at the same time?"
9620,"After an awful lot of coughing, yeah, it starts to feel a little raw.",Have you had a runny nose?
9621,"Yeah, bit of 1 back in the day, maybe a week ago, but that kind of gone away by now.",Have you felt any chest pain?
9622,Yeah. Yeah I got pain kinda on the right.,OK. Have you ever have you ever had anything like this before?
9623,"No never. Actually Doc, you're saying something that makes it feel worse? Taking a deep breath makes it feel pretty bad.","OK, and. I'm just going to circle back to this chest pain. You said you feel it on the right side. Is it always there or is it just when you take a deep breath or is it kind of on and off?"
9624,It's kind of always there. It gets a little bit worse with coughing and when I take a pretty big deep breath.,"Yeah, OK, but if you were just laying down, not coughing, is that pain there?"
9625,"Yeah yeah, specially notice over the last day,",OK.
9626,Kind of dull.,OK. And have you had any weight loss recently?
9627,"No, not really.",K. Have you traveled anywhere recently?

9744,"Oh, like, maybe like once every like 2 weeks or something.","Got it, any other substances slash drugs?"
9745,"No, like alcohol sometimes, like.","OK so no cocaine, no heroin?"
9746,No.,And have you ever um injected drugs into your body?

9748,Maybe like one one night like on the weekend.,"OK and what do you drink, how much do you drink?"
9749,"I don't know, maybe like 5 or 6 beers. I guess it just depends on the night.","Got it, got it, and other questions, when was your last menstrual period?"
9750,Maybe like 2 weeks ago?,"Two weeks ago, OK. Are you sexually active?"
9751,"Uh yeah, just with my boyfriend.","OK, so do you two use contraception, birth control?"
9752,"Yeah, we use uh like condoms.","OK, any chance you could be pregnant right now? That was a strange question to ask if you're sexually active, but any unprotected sex in the last two weeks?"
9753,No.,"Got it, alright, and we're just kind of going over things,so it sounds like you've had this cough or a cough for a little while but it's only become bad in the last three days. You're waking up at night and you're kind of bringing up this foul or not this foul but this kind of greenish sputum, but it's, no blood in it, and otherwise you don't have any constitutional symptoms so I will go review your story with the doctors. Anything else you'd like to bring up with them before I go?"
9754,"I don't think so, I just like I like I hope I just can feel better 'cause I've been missing like my exercise stuff 'cause I feel like it's just like coughing and it makes it hard to like do well.","Got it, got it. We'll see what we can do. OK, thank you very much."
9755,Chest pain.,"Chest pain, OK. When did the chest pain start?"
9756,"Um so I, I guess I I don't know if I'd really call it pain, it's it's been just very uncomfortable, like it just felt a little odd for like a week and a half. It's kind of.",A week and a half?
9757,"Yeah, it's kind of like a very sharp, strong pain uh when I take a deep breath.",OK.
9758,"But I don't notice it all the time, it's just, it's often when um I'm sitting and studying or when I'm walking, when I'm walking to school.","OK, did you have any accidents or injuries around that time?"
9759,"Uh no, nothing that I can think of.","OK, did it come on suddenly? Or is it more gradual?"
9760,"Yeah, it's uh, no it's it's pretty, it's pretty well, it seems the same each time. It kind of lasts like 20 minutes or so, um and I've tried Tylenol and I've tried Advil um and I've even tried like a like an Alka-Seltzer and it hasn't really helped very much.","OK, so it's pretty, it's not consistent throughout the day, it only happens at certain times of the day?"
9761,"Yeah, it'll come on for like 20 minutes like here and there.","OK, anything that you think triggers it?"
9762,"I don't I don't really know. Uh I was kind of worried um, I was kind of worried that it could be a heart thing, I I feel like it might it might be, it could be stress uhm but I'm I'm not really sure, my dad had a heart attack last year, he was pretty young. He's like in his 50s and it it just kind of scares me because now he's having these heart problems.","OK, so these chest pains last for about 20 minutes, it only happens when you take a deep breath in, and after the 20 minutes, do they come and go? Is it something that gradually weans off, or is it fairly sharp?"
9763,"It seems like it kind of goes away once I, once I'm at school and like talking to people and doing other things. It's kind of when I'm, I notice it when I'm on my walks when I'm alone or like when I'm studying alone more, like maybe I have it when I'm talking to other people, but I don't really notice it.","OK, does it get worse with exercise?"
9764,"Uh I don't think so. It just kind of, like when I'm walking to school, it kind of stays the same. I haven't done any strenuous exercise lately, 'cause I've just had so much uh schoolwork piling up.","So you mainly get it at, so you can get it at rest, I should say."
9765,"Exactly, yeah, like when I'm studying.","OK, any fevers? Sick at all last little while?"
9766,"Uh no, no, I don't think so.","No, you've been feeling well otherwise?"
9767,"Yeah, I mean, besides just kind of feeling stressed, I uh like I I've been trying to quit smoking and that's been, that's been kind of hard, and school's just very, very busy right now.",When did you stop smoking?
9768,"Um so like I guess I'm trying to quit, I'm smoking less than I used to. I probably smoked 5 cigarettes a day, but it used to be a little bit more.","OK, coming back to the stress, is there anything recently that's causing you more worries?"
9769,"Um it's just that I'm I'm doing my Masters of social work and I'm getting towards the end and it's just, it's very scary because I'm working on my final uh thesis and there's just a lot involved and it's it's just making me very nervous.","OK, is there anything special about the last couple of weeks that's made you more stressed than previously?"
9770,"Uh I think just the the time crunch of having to to finish this. I've never felt like so, like there is so little time to do the work that I need to do.","Got it. Have you ever felt this pain before, anytime in your life?"
9771,"No, no, not before this.","OK. So it comes on several times a day, not necessarily triggered by anything, and you said you smoke. When did you start smoking?"
9772,"Um like when I was probably 18 I I sometimes smoked a little and then I smoked a little more, um maybe like 10 cigarettes a day for uh like the last two years. But then a few months ago I've been I've been cutting it in half.","OK, now when you get this this chest pain, do you ever feel short of breath?"
9773,"Um I I think I I make myself nervous with it and then I kind of start breathing faster, but I don't have a hard, I don't have a hard time breathing otherwise, and it's hard to get a deep breath 'cause I'm, it makes me really nervous.",Does your heart ever flutter? Feel like it's skipping a beat?
9774,"Uhm no, only if I, only if I, if I, if I'm having kind of an anxiety attack that's felt like that before, but not any other time","OK, don't get any chest pain, all right, and just in terms of other things, so anything else you've seen a doctor for in the past? You mentioned anxiety attacks."
9775,"Yeah, um like I talked to my family doctor about that when I was a teenager but I really haven't, you know, seen my doctor for it anytime in the last like eight years or so.",Anything else you see your family
9776,"I don't, oh, sorry, no nothing else. I just I thought I was kind of, when I was in high school I had those and then I really haven't for a long time. But um lately I felt like this like I could maybe get them again.",So you've never had asthma as a child?
9777,Uh no.,And you don't have asthma now?
9778,No.,"OK, do you take any medications right now?"
9779,"Uh no, like I take like a multi vitamin but that's it.","OK, and you live in London?"
9780,"Mhmm, like for school.","Got it. You're doing a Masters in social work, anyone around you been sick at all last little while?"
9781,"No, like I live alone, I haven't really seen very many people lately.","OK, and how do you manage stress when you do get it?"
9782,"Um I try to I try to like set some time aside just to read books that like I like to read instead of like school books uh at night time, and uh I do really enjoy running, it's, I've been a little bit nervous to do it lately, but usually I run like a few times a week.","OK, and when you're pretty preoccupied, do you ever get the chest pain?"
9783,"Um like when I'm really, when I'm work, like working with classmates or uh like thinking really like if I'm talking to someone else, I don't really get it or if I if I'm like working on a task with my hands, but it's when I'm walking and I am alone kind of with my thoughts or when I'm studying, that's when I when I get it.","Understood and you said your father passed early from a heart attack, I'm sorry, but anyone else in your family either your parents or mum have any health issues?"
9784,"Oh he's uh he's alive, like he had a heart attack and just now he has to see a lot of heart doctors. Um no, there's nothing else in my family like that. I don't really know like about my grandpa, like my dad's dad, but like he might have also, um he just kind of, he just passed away young from um like an accident. So yeah, I'm not really sure.","Got it, so no one has died suddenly with no explanation when they were young or while they were swimming?"
9785,No.,"No one's ever talked about arrhythmias, or is that a word familiar to you?"
9786,"No, no, just my dad and his heart attack. That's like the only thing I know of.","OK, sounds good. I think I've got all the information I need and I'll pass it on to the doctor who'll take a look at you, OK? Have a good one."
9787,"Hi, um so I've had this terrible fever for the past three days um and just before that I had a stuffy nose um and I had a sore throat, well I still do, um and it's just not going away, so I thought I should just come in and see if I have covid or what it is.","OK, so if I understand, it started with a stuffy nose?"

9817,Uh yes.,OK. And any other surgeries you've had in your life?
9818,Uh no.,"No, anything you've had to see a doctor for?"

9836,Mhmm.,"OK. And then otherwise, so we talked a little bit about recent travel. It sounds like you have the hiking trip last week and you passed some people, but it sounds like your husband also has kind of similar symptoms that you do right now."
9837,Yeah.,"Sounds good, now we've already talked about kind of past medical issues. Moving on, I think what we'll do next is move on to a physical exam. But before I do that, do you have any questions for me? Anything else you feel I should know?"
9838,"No, do you think I have covid?","It's a possibility. It's always good to rule these things out, so we'll be ordering a covid swab no matter what. Obviously with any presentation where we have someone come in with a fever and sore throat, we want to rule out anything infectious. So it sounds like if your husband got it, and you have it, covid would be our first thing that we want to rule out. So just while we're trying to investigate, work this up further, I want to have you and your husband self isolate. The other question I suppose I should ask is, have you gotten your flu shot this year?"
9839,"No, I haven't.","So it's also a possibility it might be influenza, just the seasonal flu. But until we, I suppose rule out covid, it'd be best just to keep to yourself just in case you are infectious for the meanwhile."
9840,"OK, sure.","Alright, well I'm going to go talk to the Doctor and I'll be coming back in to see you, OK?"
9841,"Alright, great thank you.",Take care.
9842,"Um yeah hi, I brought I brought my 8 year old daughter here um because I've noticed that she's been quite wheezy um for the past four five days and now she has a slight cough, um sounds like she's a little short of breath, so I just wanted to get things checked out.","OK, so for the, when it first presented, about four to five days ago, what did you notice, notice first?"
9843,Um I noticed that she was wheezy um and it's it seemed like she was having some difficulty taking in deep breaths.,"OK, now was this with any type of activity or just at rest?"
9844,"Yeah, she was playing tag with one of her cousins and she she was quite out of breath after.","OK, has she ever had anything like this before?"
9845,No.,"Nothing like that, OK, and has it been fairly steady since then? Or has it been fluctuating?"
9846,It's been fluctuating.,"OK, but it hasn't really gone away in the sense that you're still concerned coming now four days later?"
9847,"Yeah, it's just it would, she would have these these uh episodes, but it would resolve on its own and then she would, you know go back to doing some sort of activity and then she would have all these symptoms all over again, but when she rests um then it goes away, so I wasn't really sure, too sure what to think of it. But now I think it's important to get it checked out, so here we are.",Has she had any fevers at home?
9848,No.,Has she had a runny nose at all at home?
9849,No.,"Has she seemed well otherwise, does she look sick?"
9850,"Yeah, she looks fine otherwise.",OK. And has she had any sick contacts recently? Anyone around her or her friends been sick?

9854,"Uh not that I've noticed, no.","OK, nothing like that, has she complained of any pain anywhere?"
9855,No.,"OK, and has she had any recent infections?"
9856,"Uh she had, actually she had a couple of infections over the past two years. Uh they would come and go uh and we took her to the doctor each time and it just ended up being some sort of viral infection.","OK, so nothing really needing antibiotics in the last couple of years?"
9857,No.,"And in terms of how she's been doing, has she been keeping up with her peers in terms of education, and how she moves, how she acts?"
9858,"Uh yeah, she's been yeah, she's been on par with her peers.","OK, so does she have a family physician?"
9859,Um yes.,"OK, so they haven't brought up any concerns about how she's growing, how she's developing?"
9860,No.,"So her weight, her height, they've been good for her age?"
9861,"Yeah, yeah.","Excellent. And has she gotten, has she been keeping up to date for immunizations?"
9862,"Yes, she's fully up to date.","Excellent. In regards to how she's doing, otherwise health, in terms of her health, has, did she see a family physician for any other medical issues that she might be having?"
9863,"Uh no, she's otherwise pretty healthy.",OK. How was the birth? Was there any complications when she was born?

9868,"Uh, she was, how much was she? I think she was about 8 kilos.",8 kilos?
9869,"Sorry 8 pounds, 8 pounds.","Yeah, no worries. And then otherwise she is, so she's been healthy otherwise, been doing well, uh just in terms of how she's been doing uh with other systems of her body, have you noticed any concerns for her bowel movements?"
9870,"Uh no, she's been pretty regular.","OK, any concerns for peeing?"
9871,"Uh no, she's been going pretty frequently and she's, yeah no changes there.","And we already talked, she hasn't had any fevers, when she coughs does she ever bring anything up?"
9872,"Uh no, I haven't noticed any phlegm, no.","OK, and when she's having these wheezy episodes, do you ever notice that she looks like she's really straining to breathe, really struggling?"
9873,"Uh yeah, so she, it's not like she turns blue or anything like that, um she just slightly slightly has a hard time catching her breath.","OK, so these usually recover on their own?"
9874,Yeah.,You don't give her anything for it?
9875,No.,"OK, uh does she have any allergies?"
9876,"Um no, well she has some seasonal allergies, but nothing that she's been tested for.","OK, do you give her anything for seasonal allergies?"

9878,No.,"OK, and this, these episodes mainly happen when she's playing with friends, so do they happen in a certain environment? Like for example, is this in a friends house or is this outdoors or has it been across different settings?"
9879,It's been across different settings but I will say it's worse when um when when there's colder weather.,OK.
9880,Yeah.,And do these episodes ever happen in your home?
9881,Yeah.,And what's the context from them happening in your home?
9882,"Um usually when she is out and about running around in the backyard with her friends um is when I've mostly noticed it, yeah.","OK, so she doesn't have any symptoms at rest?"
9883,"Oh, no.",And she doesn't have any symptoms at night?
9884,"Uh at night, so there was one one one night when she had some issues um with like wheeziness but it did resolve on its own.",OK. And did she wake up at night with that or just?
9885,"Just trouble falling asleep, I think yeah.","OK. Alright, so we already talked about, so she doesn't really have any past medical issues that she's seen a doctor for, uh any surgeries?"
9886,No surgeries.,OK. Is she taking medications right now?
9887,"Um no, no medications.",Aside from the occasional Reactine?

9897,No.,And changed your air filters?
9898,Yeah.,"Alright, excellent, so I think I have all the information I need, we're just going to do a physical exam and then I'm going to go talk to the physician and I'll come in and see your daughter and we'll talk about next steps from there. Do you have any questions that you'd like me to direct to him before that happens?"
9899,"No, thank you so much.","Alright, have a good one"
9900,"Yeah, it's uh, for the last maybe three days, um it's not really pain, not in any specific spot, it just feels a bit tight in my chest area when I breathe in especially, and it just gets a bit harder to breathe and it feels more tight like especially when I go for my walks, which I do everyday, uh I try to walk my dog. So I was just, you know, worried that it could be something serious and I wanted to come and get checked out.","OK, for sure. So you said it started about 3 days ago. Have you noticed it's been getting better, worse or about staying the same?"
9901,I think it's staying the same.,"OK, was there anything that happened 3 days ago that you can recall where you first noticed it?"
9902,"No, nothing in particular um yeah, it just kind of came on and now it's been pretty steady.","OK and when it came on three days ago, what were you doing?"
9903,Uh I think I first noticed it when I was gone for my walk.,"OK, now when you're walking, you say you have some chest tightness, do you have any chest pain?"
9904,"No, there's not there's not pain, it just feels like, when I breathe in it feels tight.","OK, did you feel anxious or sweaty or the feeling of impending doom at all?"
9905,"Uh, no I can't say that I did.","Nothing like that, OK, and did you feel yourself becoming out of breath at all?"
9906,"Uh I I feel like it was kind of harder to get a whole breath, um so yeah, yeah, I guess.","OK, and was this tightness all across your chest or was it in one particular area?"
9907,Kind of just all over.,"OK. And since then, that happened when you were out for a walk, how many times does it happen a day would you say?"
9908,"Well, I feel like it's kind of always there, but it gets worse when I go for my walk. Um and well sometimes I go for more than one walk, right, 'cause I walk my dog. It's always kind of there, and especially when I'm like getting up out of the chair, I can feel it more, or when I take a big like a big breath in, as I said.","OK, so it's been there pretty constantly for the past three days, but it's more noticeable, if not worse, when you're going for a walk?"
9909,Exactly.,OK. Have you had any cough at all in the last little while?
9910,"Uh no like I feel a little more hoarse and like there's maybe some more phlegm, like I'm clearing my throat more, but I haven't actually been coughing.","OK, any fevers?"

9914,Nope.,"OK, and have you ever had anything like this happen to you before?"
9915,"Uhm, I mean I have asthma um so I've had some trouble breathing before, it, this feels feels uh different than other times. I I guess it could be related, but uh I don't know, this this feels a bit different, that's why I wanted to come in and get it checked out.","OK, so you have asthma, do you use any puffers at the moment?"
9916,"Yeah, I just use the one that um I take every day. I don't really use the uhm, the one thats as needed because I just haven't had to in a really long time so I didn't refill my last one.","OK, so you don't have any anymore of the as needed, but you have used it in the past?"
9917,"Yeah, exactly like it's been a couple of years since I needed that, but I still I still take the daily one.",OK. And you haven't stopped taking the daily one in last three days either?
9918,"No, I always take it um so I'm supposed to actually take it morning and night, um for a while though sometimes I was skipping the night one because I didn't feel that I was needing it. Um so so lately I've been taking it everyday, but I've just been taking it in the morning.","OK, uh, what makes you say you haven't really needed the one at night? Have you just been doing well without it?"
9919,"Exactly, like I haven't needed the rescue one in a few years and even when I was just taking it in the morning, I I haven't had any problems.","OK, understood. And then have you had, I should have asked, do you work currently?"
9920,"Uh I I, I'm a financial advisor, I'm like semi retired so I do some stuff from home.","OK, got it. I suppose just, has this kind of chest tightness stopped you from doing activities that you normally would do, any missed time from work?"
9921,"I haven't missed any work, but I'm not I'm not doing a ton of work right now. I don't think it would stop me, it just would make me uncomfortable um during work and it keeps me, maybe this, the last few days, it's kept me from, I usually go on a couple of walks a day, the last couple days I've just gone on one usually so yeah, it's a little bit, yeah.","So it's really not stopping too much of your day to day functioning, but it's noticeable?"
9922,"Exactly, yeah.","OK. Now, is there any other issue that you see your doctor regularly for aside from the asthma?"
9923,"Uhm, I have uh high blood pressure, I don't really see my doctor very much, I just am on um medication.","OK, how about we just talk about your medications a little bit? What are you taking currently?"
9924,"Uh I take the, uh, salbutamol.",Yeah.
9925,"That we talked about, and I take um Ramipril.",Yep.
9926,"And, uh, sometimes a Tylenol if you know, if I have a headache or something, but not very often.","OK understood, so aside from the high blood pressure you're really not taking medications for much else?"
9927,"No, no.",OK. Do you have any other lung issues or any trouble with your lungs in the past?
9928,"No, nothing major, just the asthma. But you know, like I said, it's been a few years since it has bothered me.","OK, got it, and just in terms of your life itself, so do you smoke at all?"
9929,"No, never.","OK, so no smoking, any other recreational substances, drugs?"
9930,"Oh no, no. I mean I I have um you know a few beers on the weekend, but I don't do very, I don't do any drugs and I don't drink much other than that.","OK, got it. Any allergies that you have?"
9931,"Uhm no, no, like I, uh, when I was younger I got some seasonal allergies sometimes in the springtime, but other than that, I I like I, it's really been uh many years since I've noticed that.","OK, and so nothing new in the environment? You haven't changed where you've been living or you haven't introduced a new pet or a new dog?"
9932,Exactly.,"OK, so sounds like you're pretty much staying the course last little while, just kind of a new onset of this new chest tightness, and aside from that, seems that it comes on mainly on walks outdoors, but you've kind of been limiting the, some of the medication you're taking for asthma the last couple of years because you haven't really felt that you needed it as much."
9933,"Yeah, like just the morning was, it was enough.","OK. Alright John, I think I've got most of the information I need just to go talk to the doc and talk about your story. Next of course we're going to do a quick physical exam, going to take a listen to your lungs and see what else we might want to do in terms of investigations. I have a feeling that this actually might be your asthma reoccurring in some capacity or that would be on the top of the differential for now, barring any other new findings. So I think maybe what we would like to do is, we'd like to try having those rescue puffers available to see if that helps at all when you are on walks, and if they don't help, then we'll come back to the table and see what other possible directions we could head in in order to help you next. Does that sound good John?"
9934,"Sounds great, I'm just, you know, glad to know that it's probably not my heart.","No, it sounds well, I suppose you said that you didn't really get out of breath with exercise, more sounds like a chest tightness, and you haven't had any pain associated with it, so that puts more cardiac ischemic pictures kind of lower on the differential. But of course we're going to try one thing at a time, and then we'll come back to the table um depending on how you're feeling after that, OK?"
9935,"Sounds great, thank you.","No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, I'll be back with you in a moment."
9936,"Yes I did, it was uh it was behind my left uh knee kind of in like the joint behind where it bends. Um it was stuck pretty good, it's still kind of red and tender there. I noticed it because the back of my knee was starting to just feel a bit sore, um not the joint itself, but just kind of the skin, the whole area back there. Um and I found this tick, I brought I brought it in with me if you wanted to have a look at it, um it's in like this little plastic container, uh and I don't really know when I got it. I was hiking on Friday um and then Saturday I was out in my garden, I hope they're not around my house, I hope that it was from hiking um and not gardening, but uh I did spend a lot of time outside on Saturday as well.","OK, so sounds like it's been a little bit of time since you were last outdoors to when you first noticed it?"
9937,Yeah.,"OK, so when you picked it off the tick, obviously you have it for me, is it quite swollen or engorged?"
9938,"It's not too bad, um I I have actually had a tick in the past and this is a long time ago and um maybe like 10 years and I actually had that kind of target rash thing that they talk about. And, uh at that time I remember I had to take antibiotics for a bit. Um this um didn't look like that, it was more, it was just kind of sore in one spot, I don't think it um it was as bad as that time and the tick that time, sorry I've kind of gotten off track, that time it was quite swollen, this one was maybe a little bit, but not as much.","OK, so just in terms of the tick's size, it doesn't look like it's been feeding for too long, so when ticks uh are feeding they tend to engorge, they tend to swell up, so this looks more like a tiny little bug or does it kind of look like a little grape, almost like it's been swollen up with blood?"
9939,"No, this one, this one's pretty small.","This one's pretty small, OK. And I should mention that, well obviously you've had a tick bite in the past, the big concern for us is a disease called Lyme disease, which is spread by bacteria, but in fact only one type of tick predominantly is a transmission transmitory agent for it. It's called a deer tick, and its coloration, it's got a little bit of a brown butt and there's some black legs. Does it look like that at all?"
9940,"I don't think so, uhm, I uh I was looking at the pictures online, I think it looks like the other kind of tick, um but I heard that, yeah, but I heard that lately now they've been considering all ticks in this area as possibly carriers of Lyme um because I think it's kind of become more more of a problem sm so that was making me a bit nervous.","OK, absolutely, what we can do is we can send this tick off to the lab and they'll be able to identify the species for it, but for tick bites in general, one of the key considerations is for how long it's been on your body for. So unfortunately, if you're out on Friday and Saturday, that'd mean that this tick has been on you for longer than at least 72 hours. So I think one way or another, we're likely going to have to put you on antibiotics just as kind of a prophylactic at the very least, just want to make sure that um you're not at risk of developing Lyme disease. I'm sure you've heard from the news that Lyme disease can present in a variety of ways, but it's a disease that we try our best to avoid. And just in terms of your symptoms, so you say you've had a bite in the past and you you've got that rash before, that kind of bullseye rash, do you have that rash now?"
9941,"No, I don't uh as far as I know, I mean, you can have a look too. It's behind my knee, so it's not the easiest place to see, but it's uh it looks a little red, it's like tender where the tick was, but I don't see that like larger circle rash.","OK, that's reassuring. Now any, it'd be pretty unlikely for you to have other symptoms, but just in case, do you have any other joint pain?"
9942,No.,Have you been feeling ill or have been feverish in the last little while?
9943,"No, no, I've been fine.","OK, and you removed that twit tick once you found it, you presented to me, have you checked your body for any other possible bites?"
9944,"Oh yeah, I looked around and I looked at my husband too 'cause we we were just a little bit, you know, gave us a little bit of a scare, but no, there's been nothing else.",That's good. And did you bring a pet with you at all when you were hiking and gardening?
9945,"Uh no, I didn't, no.","OK, good. Any other family members you think might have been exposed?"
9946,Uh no it was just uh me and my husband.,"OK, and what geographic area were you in um when you were hiking?"
9947,We were uh in Strathroy along the creek.,"OK. I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up to see if we should be a little bit concerned or not. Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point, so I think that we will be moving forward with antibiotics, but of course we'll be talking to the physician who'll be having a look at you as well. So it sounds like you haven't been having too much symptoms aside from you've noticed this tick, the skin around it is fairly sore and you've had this in the past, but you were treated with antibiotics in the past and since then you haven't had too many health problems after that?"
9948,"No, no. I've been pretty healthy.","OK, and just about your health right now, is there anything that you see the family physician or doctor for in general and regarding your health?"
9949,Uh just for my cholesterol.,"OK, are you taking and medications for that?"
9950,"Uh Yeah, I take a uh statin, can't remember which one.","OK, got it. And do you have any allergies?"
9951,Uh no.,So no drug allergies?
9952,No.,"OK, now we've already talked about other exposures, so it doesn't sound like anyone else in your family or any pets are around, so it's unlikely that you have ticks coming in and you said you might have gotten this from gardening, but um you're hoping that your area doesn't have ticks. Maybe just take a look, ticks like to live in long grass, kind of on the intersection between woods and fields to see if there's any hovering around that kind of make a waving motion with their legs and they're sometimes easy to spot, you might wanna get some insecticide out there. But it sounds like this is fairly recent, unfortunately just for the length of time this tick might be on you for, it's probably safer than not to start you on some medications, but I'm going to go talk to the doctor after we do a quick physical exam, and we might also send the tick off to a local laboratory so they can identify the species for it definitively, as well as might just send some blood work just to see if there's any titres or any serology that would make us a little bit more concerned for Lyme disease. But aside from that you've been feeling well otherwise?"
9953,"Yeah, totally fine. It was just a little tender there and that's the only reason I looked.",OK. So no headaches?
9954,No.,Nothing like that?
9955,Nothing like that.,"OK, excellent, alright. I'm fairly happy with what we talked about today. Do you have any questions for me Jean?"
9956,"No, this is pretty well what I expected today, so thanks for helping me out.","No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, we'll come back and talk to you, OK?"
9957,"Great, thanks.",Thanks Jean.
