a little sleep a little Slumber and poverty will catch up to you like a thief in the night how many of you have heard that saying before quite a number of us some of you motivational speakers you spited you're going around telling people that this particular verse probably means that people should not sleep at all meanwhile he's talking about laziness because what it actually means is that a little more sleep a little more Slumber a little folding of the hands you see I used to read Bible too but that's not why we're here we're here to tell you about why you should sleep more and why sleep is very important to your life but not just that the important secrets you need to actually have a night's sleep because some of us are using it and we are sleeping peacefully like babies no babies don't sleep the person that came up with that line sleep like a baby has never been around babies if you have been around babies you know that babies don't sleep you think oh I sleeping like a baby you're a liar babies will wake up 17 PS in the middle of the night looking for breath and guess who they going to wake you that do not have breast please before we go into this video can you just kindly do us a favor and and just subscribe it's not hard just one press of the button subscribe if you're here from other places where you did not sign to YouTube you probably need to sign in order to subscribe but the reason you're doing that is so that you can be here when new videos come out and so that this channel can grow that's why but let's get into it there's no sleep for the wicked but you even you are wicked you're going to sleep I'm going to make sure that you're going to sleep your body does not care about all these opinions that I just mentioned your body just wants to sleep you cannot walk all the time and then when when it's not time to sleep you can't find it even though you're are wicked you must sleep wrong now it takes energy to be Wicked so you need to also sleep in order to refresh the energy to be more wicked to other people even all of us are going to get our due at the end of the day we don't know when that is so please my dear is important that you pay attention to this video so that you sleep properly because not getting enough sleep can actually have negative effects on your life number one bad memory and forgetfulness if you start to notice that ah I said this thing before I canot remember it again sleep not thinking clearly an inability to focus mood swings emotional problems sometimes that your bab is giving you problem because she has not had enough sleep wake immune system weight gain your metabolism is slower sleep is also more than just resting or is important for you to be able to even give births yes is that important so make it the priority if you're charging your phone right now you know that charging your phone is actually very important how do how come you not think that sleeping is not as important as charging your phone now let's get into the secrets number one is is there space here is there space here there's space there okay number one is stick to a regular sleep schedule let me explain you need to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day even on weekends this because your body has an internal clock that is not the one on your wrist the internal clock is known as a psyched R your body knows that by this time I should start winding down to sleep you know once before that's why that's why you even know why chicken knows the time chicken just wakes up in the morning it's that we used to do when we kids sh just know that we used to play when we kids but chicken knows the time even respective of the time that's because there psychian reading your own psychian reading requires you to actually keep a particular sleep Shadow some of you today you sleep by 7:00 tomorrow you sleep by midnight tomorrow morning you sleep by 2: a.m. another day you sleep by 5:00 a can see you're confusing your body's interal clock it's going to be difficult for you to find sleep there are some things that are fect this your psychian Rh I'm sure we will explain them as we go in this video number two tip is you need to meditate in order to calm your mind there's something called meditation not the one you do that's not just what meditation is even if it's very a few minutes just do it before bed to help you relax sometimes it could be calming breaths you hold in I've T you guys before the 678 method you breath in for seven seconds you hold for 8 seconds and you breathe out for 9 seconds you can see how simple it is because before you even sleep how many of you drive into your compound at the same speed that you are on thir Millan bridge on so it means that as you're getting closer to bedtime you need to slowly wind down not the same energy you have in the morning the same energy you have in the evening you're not going to sleep oh so that means that even that regular that scheduling the meditation that we're talking about means putting your phone away closing your work laptop working from home does not mean that you're going to work all the time even though the person that Ed think this video needs to work all the time just meditate meditate before you sleep try and do it every day so that you can at least rest another tip is please stop taking alcohol and limit your caffeine especially before bed you see there's caffeine when you take coffee when you take tea when you take chocolate is inside and it can keep you awake espe if you have too much after 300 p.m. so immediately it's 3: p.m. please stop taking these things another thing that you think the alcohol makes you sleep no alcohol depresses you does not lead to good sleep that's why I wake up in the morning and feels like you're are tired how do you feel tired after sleeping when you take a call night before I see that there's a problem yes that you find it easier to off does not mean you're sleepy and that's because sleep has different stages of sleep I'm going to explain it in another video If you think it the requires his own video put it in the comment section it's not every time it's me I'll be talking youself talk your own number four te even though as I'm saying this one is passing from this ear and is coming out from the other a avoid screens before bed the lights from your phone the light from your computer the light from your TV can mess with your sleep hormone the name of this hormone is called melatonine and if you turn your screen off 30 to 45 minutes before bed it will do something relaxing find music play it in the background do something else that blue light that is emanating is and that once that light enters inside your body it goes inside your body tells your body you see melatonin don't increase melatonin melatonin is reduced if melatonin is reduced you cannot sleep because you're awake it's not me that cost it it's the bre light from your phone for you say and if you're watching this video in the night please off it and go and sleep you can continue tomorrow morning number five TI if you cannot sleep don't be staying in bed if you awake in bed for more than 20 minutes don't stress just get up and do something else come you can find read a book I not say screen read find physical book and read some of you don't know what paper feels like everything now preform find physical book and read do something exercise this can probably even Force you up to St you can find that TT book that your lecturer said that you should read by the time you read for like 20 seconds sleep will catch you I know you yes because you get bored quick but if it's insta blog now you're going to be on this for 3 hours till the next morning so please find something that is not sleep and do number six go outside and see sunlight yes so when I tell you people go outside and touch grass is very important the reason is that sunlight is also responsible for part of the Melatonin that is secreted by your body so that when you're not getting enough sunlight your body now increases melatonin when there's sunlight melatonin reduces well if you get that sunlight in the morning you reduce melatonin so that towards the end of the day as melatonin is rising you begin to feel sleepy number seven don't exercise too late yes I know hey why you say we should I did not say do exercise at all I just say do exercise too late there's a reason even do exercise is great for sleep but doing it even the exercise is good for sleep but doing it at the right time can be a problem try to finish your workout at least 3 hours before you plan to sleep anything more than that your body is just in a hyper State and it's going to actually prevent you from sleeping but if you say you must do something like you must sleep at least try and do some stretches or yoga number eight please pay attention to your mental health and your stress level if you're feeling anxious you're feeling like ah your landlord is disturbing you hope you know that if your landlord is disturbing you you cannot sleep if you can sleep while your landlord is disturbing you then you are the kind you're just like Jesus Christ that was sleeping on boot that wanted to capsize we don't know what's play the drum for you so please if you're anxious you're stressed there's a deadline you know that it's going to be very difficult to sleep however one of the things that I do is that I tell myself that there are certain things that are within my control and there are certain things that are not within my control the things that are within my control I control it the things that are not within my control I leave it why am I trusting myself about something that is not my control that's what you're doing so please relax what we happen we happen cannot do anything number nine what's what you eat before bed watch what you eat before you sleep yes some of you when it's time to sleep that's when you will pack seven wraps of Fufu three wraps of SEO and four wraps of ped yum and put inside your belly and wonder why it cannot sleep it can't happen yes the reason is most times when you have that much food in you it's going to affect you you're going to have what you call gastric oag reflux disease see director do something where you can see food just put pipe as see you can see that's what's going to cause that's what's going to happen to you and you definitely find it difficult to sleep why because it's affecting your ability to relax but I know some of you have not seen food since morning you're doing 001 so that opportunity you have to eat you think that you're going to eat all the food that you miss that day in that particular one night you're messing up your sleep you're going to wake up multiple times in the night and then wonder why you're not sleeping properly it will affect your ability to walk tomorrow and just because they doing 001 I want to finish other that food that day your boss will be looking at you in the work and be wondering why you're not remembering the things is telling you so you see drop that bar reduce the size eat healthy food thank you very much number 10 tip is take a shower before bed yes it does two things number one is that when you take a shower it can relax your muscles drop your body's temperature so that it makes it easier for you to fall asleep there's research actually showing this director just put plenty papers where this resar don't let it stay too long so that they will read it yes there's plent that taking a shower before bed is your sleep simple and some of you also does they have not B since morning that's an opportunity for you to actually bath and sleep so that then last but not the least make your bedroom sleep friendly if you're living in one room apartment this video is not for you that's if your room is your paror your room your office this is not for you but if you have another room that is not your bedroom please remove work from your bedroom first of all some of you have your office table inside your bedroom so in your head your your room is where you walk how do you think that mentally where you think where you walk is where you're going to sleep somebody's looking at me wondering if I'm seeing the window into their own house yes I can see yes yes I can see so remove that your office table from your bedroom put it in your paror but if you're living in one room it's fine you understand life happens in stages this is just one of those stages you're going to cross over to the next side very

in life if you don't make 10,000 steps it feels like you're failure me I'm been tracking since 1942 I'm never going to 10,000 steps but wait what if I tell you that all these 10,000 steps is just advertisement it's marketing because we need to we need to ask some questions but I need to sit down first before and explain it the questions we need to ask is do we really need to work 10,000 steps must still really be 10,000 and where did this number even come from story story story story The orig of this number is actually very interesting and some of you may be surprised to know that he did not come from any medical research or one grand scientific discovery instead it was in Japan in the 1960s for a market campaign they made a pedometer a pedometer is simply something that measures your steps and the name of it is called MCO mokai M Kai see you just know that the meaning is 10,000 steps and then it became a marketing gimmick before you know what's happening Fitness standard goal everything now at the end of the day you look at your Smartwatch and then your smart tells you that you have less than 10,000 steps and you start to feel bad no you shouldn't feel bad because he resarch is even showing that even a small amount of working every day is an important exercise that greatly improves your health for example a simple 10 to 15 minute walk in the afternoon can boost

Dementia in old age and the best part walking is free is free it does not require any special equipment or outfits there's nothing yes or sometimes you need to get comfortable shoes though but here

have you seen any case in which Abu has killed cancer in my experience no somebody is telling them bring the child to the Village what are they doing in that Lagos and then they take them and by the time they're coming back the mothers will actually literally bring them half dead so you have to start to resuscitate them first because you can't even treat the cancer at this stage I have people who are close to me whose children have cancers I'm dealing with one presently they told her your child has cancer and she runs off to church it gets worse she comes back we start to treat she's getting better and she runs off again and now she's gone we're looking for her in the sense that we're calling her and she's not coming because she feels that okay I'm done how affordable is cancer treatment in Nigeria cancer treatment anywhere in the world is not affordable so what are the signs that some parents can look out something's going in your child's eye blood cancers for instance yeah there are no specific symptoms can look like malaria can look like any other illness do they have fever they can have jund this yellowness of the eyes so everything that is fever is not malaria have to bring the child to a hospital for the whs tumor which is the kidney cancer we have over 95% cure rate and I mean cure so you can put cancer and cure in the same sentence yes cancers are cured just coming early and that is the problem that we have in this Society people don't present early no study that has been done that shows that sugar has been implicated in worsening or making a cancer worse there not many oncologist in Nigeria my name Isa fak I'm a pediatrician and I treat children living with cancer welcome to on clog with AO doctor and today we're going to be having a conversation about cancer but not just any type of cancer it's a cancer that occurs in children your Evo people call it pediatric cancer you know me I'm not EO I'm with you people and today joining us is drona fak don't forget to subscribe don't forget to like don't forget to share the reason is this we know that conversations like this are not popular but the more you do these things the more those conversations get shown to other people and it supports us so that we can get more people like her on the channel could you tell us a little bit about yourself I'm ugak as he has already said I'm a pediatric hematologist oncologist meaning that I manage children living with cancer all types of cancer and also children living with other disorders that are related to the blood like CLE cell hemophilia or talasia I schooled I grew up in Lagos I schooled at the prestigious University of Lagos the first degree in physiology and then I wasn't satisfied and I'm like this medicine I must do it then I went back and I did my medicine and then of course for the love of Pediatrics I dealt into Pediatrics and while in residency I Found Love for um Hematology Oncology and the reason was because I saw how children living with cancer were managed particularly in that sense Center how the doctors and the residents poured out themselves in that unit and in the management of the children we had better outcomes based on that because the patients were able to you know listen to them and take all the advice and there was a better outcome and I thought that being in that space I could make a difference and here I am making a difference of course let's talk about cancer and I'm going to ask what exactly is cancer so first of all to break down the meat cancer is not just one disease so you don't say he has cancer so he has a type of cancer so there different types of cancer but cancer means when the body cells begin to mutate mutate means change so the normal cells begin to change and overgrow themselves or um just changing their genes so the formation something goes off it's deleted or more are formed in the production of the cells so that's what happens in cancer so cancer is a disorder that happens and occurs in all parts of the body any part of the body can have a cancer that means a part of the the cell the body cell just changed or mutated the way we say it in medical terms some children come down with cancer mhm and most people think cancer has to be related to something that you do so what did these children do in order to get cancer so the children didn't do anything as a matter of fact cancers in children have no risk factor as opposed to those in adults so for an adult for instance they tell you do not smoke you'll reduce your chances of having lung cancer okay do leave healthy lifestyle don't be obese don't drink alcohol to avoid liver cancer but in children there are no risk factors like I said it's just the genes in their body mutating okay changing its form its shape its number all right so I would let me use a a an easy way for people to understand go ahead so imagine a switch you can turn on and off so when your cell is being produced your body has a natural switch turn off the body has produced enough cells so off right now there are times when that spech that switch gets bad now what causes it to get bad we don't know okay so rather than it's turning off when it's supposed to turn off it just doesn't so it just keeps those cells more of the cells keep producing and because more of the cells are producing they're not producing quality they're not producing the cells are not being produced as they should so they just there just number okay and those cells are not functionally okay and those are what we now call the cancer cells like enens which are cancer cells genes that can change and yes but how common is it ah so cancers are actually more common than we think so I go somewhere and I say oh I'm a pediatric hematologist and people are saying what's that and I say I treat children living with cancer and they look at me like children they get cancer yeah children have cancer because of these things now canc cancers range from eye cancers so we have the ones we call retinol blastoma that affect the eyes we have the kidney cancers nephroblastoma or wham's tumor we have blood cancers like leukemia we also have bone cancers any part of the body any organ in the body can have a cancer the skin can have a cancer the mouth can have a cancer anywhere nose anywhere can have cancer bone intestines anything lymph nodes can have cancer your Li SP everywhere so yes so when we say cancer is cancer of something yes so cancer of the eye cancer of the bone cancer cancer of the brain cancer of the brain exactly anywhere there is a cell exactly and every part of our body has cells yeah all parts of the body have originated or generated from cells so any part of the body can come down with cancer that's a scary thing when you think about it s back to back to Pediatric cancer at the possible causes do you think they've they got it from their parents no no I don't think that they got it from the parents but sometimes the genetic mutation when the genes are mutated in the parent the child can actually inherit that Gene that can get mutated so which can change mutation means change so once the child inherits that Gene that has changed or can change then in his own body it can also change so he can change in his kidneys and give and come up with tumor or in the brain so any part of his organ can have that mutation and Child come down with that cancer yeah in this part of the world we have the God forbid syndrome so I'm pretty sure some people are watching this and they're like you know what it's not my portion it's not the portion of my family me and my family we don't have cancer in any form but there are some other people that are paying attention and they are starting to wonder is there a way we can catch this cancer and children early enough if yes what are the signs to look out for for the solid tumors so the solid tumors are the tumors that grow you can see you can actually see it grow it's easier to identify so you see something's going in your child's eye so you a mother for instance will say at night if I look my child eye they look like cats which is what we get a lot for the children who have eye cancers all right sometimes the eyes are protruding or you see a growth you feel a Mass something in the stomach or something anywhere swelling you can identify that this is abnormal yeah so you have to go to the hospital on the other hand for blood cancers for instance yes there are no specific symptoms so the symptoms are non-specific can look like malaria can look like any other illness so they have fever they can have gundies yellowness of the eyes okay so you have I've had people who come oh my child I see say eye they yellow or in mouth they white I carry go I give him a go or I carry and go somewhere I know then say in blood shot then give him blood and it keeps happening you have to bring the child to a hospital so everything that is fever is not malaria I like that everything that all fever is not malaria yes which is what we get everybody goes to hospital they say typhoid and malaria it's not all about typhoid and malaria you need to look deeper and think deeper and think out of the box I will take you back a bit every fever is not malaria why does fever happen exactly okay so fever happens because um blood cancers for instance affect our body soldiers so God has put soldiers in our body to help us fight infection the natural now these soldiers have a number they should be now by the time the numbers when I told you about the switch Thing by the time that switch goes bad and the numbers increase the function of the white blood cell diminishes because because the bone marrow is occupied by cells that are not normal so these cells are not functioning well it means that any infection the body is not able to fight F so that's what happens and we get that a lot so many of the patients who we treat for leukemia come and say oh started with a fever and then we do the labs block test and we see these things okay so you guys are hearing it not every fever is malaria and if your child is having recurrent fevers please take them to a proper hospital and get them to see a pediatrician because to be honest not every doctor would suspect cancer on at First Sight you know but over time especially repeated infections we take your child to see a pediatrician and that might just be the help that they need let's now CM down to Nigeria what are the chances of a child with cancer surviving in Nigeria averagely real so I would I won't talk about it generally so I many children living with cancer all types of cancer so in Nigeria and in my Center in Lagos I'll will speak to Lagos we have for the WIS tumor which is the kidney cancer we have over 95% cure rate and I mean cure so you can put cancer and cure in the same sentence yes cancers are cured just coming early and that is the problem that we have is a society people don't present early people have like the God forbid syndrome I have people who are close to me close friends whose children have cancers I'm dealing with one presently a friend child has cancer they told her your child has cancer and she runs off to church forgive me church is good I'm a Christian but let us do the work while you pray and then she runs off and it gets bad gets worse she comes back we start to treat she's getting better and she runs off again and now she's gone we're looking for her in the sense that we're calling her and she's not coming because she feels that okay I'm done so these are some of the issues that we have late presentation abandonment of treatment and things like that what if what if people abandon treatment or come L to the hospital simply because they can't afford it that's that is that is a possible cost which you know we can't ignore the question how affordable is cancer treatment in Nigeria cancer treatment anywhere in the world is not affordable you're actually they say that you one cancer away from bankruptcy and that is true and bearing in mind the economic situation most of our most of the patients who manage don't have the money but come in we have ways we we partner in Lagos now I'm speaking for Lagos we partner with philanthropists NOS that come in every once in a while provide the medications that these children need give them money for um services like Labs x-rays Imaging and all of that so come in first we'll take you from there how many pediatric oncologists are there in Nigeria how many doctors like you currently treat children for cancer in Nigeria H so if I look to our society so I belong to the Nigerian Society of pediatric oncology is a society that you know all in compass in Nigeria I don't think we are up to 50 Pediatric himat olist oncologist that's scattered all around the world and of course in the metropolitan City like Lagos there more of us when you compare to the north for instance so yeah we're not we're not many they're not many of us there are not many oncologist in Nigeria so it means that the children who are born in other parts of the country have to find their way to a metropolitan City or something yeah like Cano so Cano Abuja pacot Caba B Ela you know maybe little little pockets of Institutions so how can these centers be able to treat this treat or manage yes this number of people and same thing happens everywhere in Nigeria there seems to be an imbalance right and the imbalance has always been we do not have enough doctors to treat the Nigerian public generally and then we do not have enough pediatric ecologists to be able to treat the number of children with cancer the rate of cancer in children does it seem to be increasing reducing or just the same I think it's increasing and I would attribute it to people being more aware um parents are more educated parents are more able to identify when things are abnormal so people are aware and they're bringing the children to hospital so we're seeing more of these cases we're also winning in the Battle of cancer so let's talk about health insurance why are you going there health insurance because you mentioned most people are one cancer away from poverty yeah if you live in this economy currently as it is I would even I wouldn't even say cancer I would say one disease away from bankruptcy how many health insurance schems do you know that offer Cancer Care or cover none that I know none that I know but um people who work in multinationals and all of that are able to fund their staff I've had that example you know I had a child a little girl 2-year-old who had lever cancer um and the mother was working in an oil company and all of her treatment was funded by by the mother's company even when she had to have a surgery and it couldn't be done she had to go somewhere else to do it the company fund fed it and then she came back and completed her treatment all fully funded so basically the average Nigerian who has cancer has to pay out of pockets yes people pay out of pocket the child who has cancer is not their only child they have other children who have to be taken care of have to go to school have to feed mom is in the hospital has lost her job job or she can't do her business because she's caring for her child so it's just the father who is you know struggling and trying to get the fund so it's really tough it's really really tough sometimes the doctors we have to contribute money donate money go and do bamban call in on so so please I have this child who needs money can you donate money and you know and that's how we we we go by do you think that this mode of treatment affects the treatment generally I would say so yes it does because when they get tired and frustrated and they don't get help they go they resign to their fi and they go away they go which is really sad y they go away philanthropist people who are well meaning we have a lot of them in Nigeria they need to you know be active help people fund these treatments there many indent um indent patients who need this treatment so it would be nice for people who have who have means to actually fund and help to see to it that these children get cure are there other ways to treat cancer aside from chemotherapy so there are other ways to treat so in cancer management um there are three modalities so the cotherapy is the giving of the drugs and then we have the surgery so for the solid tumor so if you have like a swelling anywhere in your body you have to take it out that's is surgery surgery and then radiotherapy where you use radiation like x-ray some form of Ray to to Target Target where that tumor had been removed and sort it out but um the blood cancers are mainly by chemotherapy how about radiotherapy um I'm pretty sure for us to do that you need a machine oh yes how many of those are in Nigeria so there a few centers that have machines Lu has a machine I think a private house M Ruth and um um a few other places have the radiotherapy machines but they they have hardly not enough the amount of machines that are even in Legos are not enough to cater to leoan and then we have people coming from out of state to you know utilize that service so it's not not enough okay prob because of how expensive it is we're always looking for alternative measures and I'm looking on this side and I can understand it doesn't mean I condone it but it's expensive and if you go online right now you see people talking about oh use seeds use alkaline water I we we we had someone here recently and um she's currently fighting breast cancer and one one of the things that they told her was you know cancer feeds on sugar so if you take away the sugar you kill the cancer cells how true is that so I think that's a myth okay um like I said cancer cells are from your cells so if you stab the cancer cells of sugar yes also staring your cells that are supposed to help your body of the sugar your body needs sugar as a form of energy so everything should be done in modertion eating sugar or taking ice cream or taking a drink is not going to multiply the cancer it's not going to worsen the cancer there's no no study that has been done that shows that sugar has been implicated in worsening or making a cancer worse so that's a myth and it should be busted really uh but they'll link you to online pages that say you know if you stop sugar you stop cancer like I said I believe I believe in research and fact no paper has come to say we've done this research and we found that the people who had sugar while they had cancer and those who didn't have sugar there was a decrease no study of such has been done and the funny thing is and children that I manage a child wants to have a drink a child wants to have a chocolate drink a child want to have ice cream as a matter of fact when we have complications from our chemotherapy treatment we use ice cream because they have what we call M icies so they have SS in their mouth they're not able to eat they're not able to drink or because ice cream is sweet it's cold it suits them so we actually give them ice cream or something cold like a lollipop and it helps to soup them while they're in that state of pain and discomfort so sugar has no relationship sugar has no relationship with making cancers worse or curing cancer elimination of sugar curing cancer no that's a me how about alkaline water some people have stopped drinking normal water and they focus on alkaline water because somebody says it kills cancer is that true I mean I've heard I've heard so many people say oh take alkaline water because your body needs an alkaline environment while that is true alkaline en environment is better than acidic environment but um once someone has got a cancer I don't think that taking alkaline water is going to be the cure go see cure via treatment chemotherapy surgery or radiotherapy and or radiotherapy another only people have is is that we are not paying attention to Har remedies in Nigeria yeah both people are shouting we have KS have you seen any case in which Abu has killed cancer in my experience no what's your experience um my experience I've say that when they take these things and they come to us they come at a very first state so you manage them and somebody is telling them come to the village now we will treat them you know we've had several cases like that bring the child to the Village what are they doing in that Lagos and then they take them and by the time they're coming back the mothers will actually literally bring them half dead so you have to start to resuscitate them first because you can't even treat the cancer at this stage you have to begin to resuscitate them person take their check cut out their renal function their kidney function liver function before you now begin to treat the cancer that they were trying to treat with the ago now ago is not is is medicinal it's not it's not a fox it's it's not a lie okay because most of our drugs that we actually take come from plants yes okay so the Coco damals the cycl the chemotherapy medication cyclophosphomide is plant all right some of them come from insects or stuff like that okay so by the time you give these things yes it may have an effect but you don't know the dose you're just giving you once the cumulative dose you're giving you just take one cup two times a day what amount is in that cup some of these things have a toxic limit there's a medication called V Christine you can't give more than 2 milligram of V Christine no in an adult in a child you can't give so regardless of the weight or the age of the child you can't give more than a certain number so imagine a drug that's that um stimulates the function of v Christine for instance and then you're going to give like a 5 milligram or a 10 milligram because you don't know the dose it's not Quantified and but but they'll tell you that has no side effect but our drugs evenin Christine and the other cyclophosphamid have side effects how TR is that I don't think that it doesn't have side effects everything has side effects when you eat too much there's side effect now obesity even when you drink too much water when you drink too much water when you take alcohol when you take all the night things there there side effects so they can't say oh they are no side effects there are side effects it's just that they're not documented we have documentation of the side effect of our medications so that's why everybody knows the side effect how many children have you treated for cancers uh just an estimate so um I've been in the cancer space since 20 fully in the cancer space since 2019 and in my Center I don't want to call the name of my Center so course in my Center we manage up to 180 to 200 cases in a year okay now I'm talking new cases yeah new new cases so every year in a year okay in a whole year so you can imagine M do the math so even if I say 100,000 per year I've managed up to 400 new cas cases now these new cases become old cases and newer ones come every year okay so yes and that's a very different different types it's not um so um overseas you have a doctor who manages him leukemia you have the one who does osteos saroma or the one who does wi tumor you have the doctors or the oncologist that do them or in here there are not many of us so all of us manage everything almost everything yeah so we haven't split it into you portions have you ever had a case where cancer or solid cancer or a blood cancer miraculously disappears you've had a lot of cases I don't know about miraculously but we' we've cured many so cancer can be cured like I said when you present early treatment is commenced early and then you abide by the treatment you don't abandon the treatment you see to it to the end they cure them 5 years after they are cancer free because we'll have to monitor them after the treatment we'll have to monitor them for 5 years before we give you like a clean bill and say okay cancer is cured 5 years after your treatment and we have people who have done 5 years 6 years doing okay so if I'm to paraphrase what you said in your experience people who have adhered to treatment religiously have been able to cure cancer yes those who have happens I've always had to come back usually in worst states so are you saying that in your experience there hasn't been a case of somebody who abandons treatment came back and said oh there's a miracle I did a test and all of a sudden the cancer is no longer no I've never experienced that no I think we need to calculate the number of cases you've seen first and then put that experienc that no okay is cancer contagious no it's not it's not contagious in any way no so a child who has cancer can sleep with their sibling on the same bed and they won't have the cancer their mom stays with them we doctors we manage them we don't get the cancer no it's not contagious have you ever being emotionally affected by a patient yeah many times many times so um so I'll take you back let me dag you back to when I started when I was thinking of where to go where to Roost and I said oh this oncology I like it though but it's too morbid now I don't think I can do it I'm too emotional and my mentor Dr akinete he says go don't worry I'll teach you how to do oncology with your head and not your heart you have to learn to do oncology with your head okay and that he did but we're still human okay I try not to get so close I do my best I put in my best I give my patients the very best but I try not to have that closeness but sometimes many times the closeness still comes in no matter how I try I have two you know particular patients that come to mind and as I'm thinking about it now like I feel like I want to cry okay the first one a boy 11 year old about the age of my child I tried so much not to be close to this boy but he wouldn't let me go he was just an adorable child his mom was very annoying but she would then because she knew that her son and I had this closeness when she messes up and she knows I'm upset with her she will send him to me and once she he just says Dr faak is like I melt because he's just an adorable child he had lukemia and he had a very bad form that required transplant and like you know in Nigeria we're not providing transplant for oncology cases and of course he succumbed to the illness on the day he succumbed I had come in because his mom had called me that he was bad so I came in and he was so bad we had tried I see you everything and he passed I know that for like a week I still looked at his picture yesterday wow this particular boy I still looked at his picture yesterday and I think about him all the time because he will literally hung me when he sees me like I don't want to talk about anymore and then the second one would be a young girl very brilliant girl she actually came from the north um she didn't have a blood cancer she had like a she had a tumor and she also passed from the tumor because it was it had spread so there was really nothing more to p through but she was just an adorable child and she passed as well and I wept as a m people were actually telling me story like her mom was telling me doctor is okay you put right sorry okay don't cry wow the girl was you know so those two patients know come to mind I've lost many other patients that I was attached to but I think you know maybe because they're recent and you know for me to even have a picture of that boy tell you how close we were well he's late now I still I still try to visit his mom maybe to get closure I don't know but yeah how do you protect yourself I just I pray okay I'm Catholic so I say my rosary and I just ask the mother Mary for grace and that's how I go by any tips for the doctors who might want to yeah so speak out talk to your friends talk to your colleagues um reach out okay reach out to your colleagues who are psychologists to give you that mental support you know you you need a lot of that even if even if you're not in the ecology space people die every day so you need a lot of support you need Family Support particularly you need strong family support siblings your husband your child you need support doctors are humans they're not all evil and we have feelings too yeah these cases especially the two did it happen at the beginning of your career of your of your career rather or toward the middle or very recently these two yes that was like one was in 2023 and the other one was like middle 2024 so this boy was like middle 2024 so it really doesn't even matter how long you've no I had I've had other people who you know early in my career when I was still you know young agile active full of adrenaline yeah I've had that where I was in and I I actually knelt down and broke down and cried does it does it feel like you're a little bit more numb now when it comes to your emotions than no I'm not numb I'm not numb at all I'm not numb I feel it it's just that um I go away to to cry I shut myself cry it out and I come out and I'm fine I talk about it what do you think the future is for can treatments in Nigeria especially for children I think that the future is bright I think there's hope in the Horizon um there's a lot of Innovations you know people are more interested now a baates not as much as we want them to um so um cancer is real cancer is in children is real it can be cured people need to present early people need to commence the treatment early people need to be compliant with their treatment so that we can achieve a cure together we can do this we need support we need people to support us in the Cure and in the management of children living with cancer we cannot do this alone it has to be a collective effort thank you so much for that um it's been a wonderful conversation and uh I'll just wrap up with this there are some families out there who might be looking for help when it comes to treating cancer do you know currently of any NGO it doesn't have to be a it doesn't we're just trying to help yeah do you know of anybody any NGO that currently offers that kind of supports yeah for children with cancer at least two particularly come to mind who are very responsive and um they they they they answer when we call and that will be the docker Cancer Foundation and children living with Cancer Foundation those two foundations okay and of of course um the um what did Lions Club those people are amazing Lions Club the KO I don't know how they call their districts and all of that but they've been amazing lion club was able to procure presses for a child who had um osteos saaca her limb and she had an amputation a disarticulation means she had an utation from her he and they provided her with the pris today she's able to walk you know she's learning but she's able to walk when she wears her long gown you don't even know that she has uh one one leg gun okay so we have these people who come in and provide help so we need many more of those people of those people we need a lot more of them but do you think we can Ure our way out of this because usually the because usually when it when it comes to the support system surrounding cancer it's just well meaning individuals but do you think that's in itself is sustainable I mean the government needs to do more work but um while we're waiting on the government we can also rely on the NOS we can actually NGO our way out of this like you say you know rely on the Nos and philanthropist there are many people who have money in Nigeria that can support So yeah thank than you so much Dr fak it's been a pleasure having this conversation my pleasure being here and I hope that you've learned a lot from this conversation um if you have more questions please put them in the comment section if you think that somebody around you is going to benefit from this please send it to them I'm going to leave here with one thing cancer in children can be killed
